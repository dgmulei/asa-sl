Executive Summary
This report is a revision to the Final Cost-Benefit Analysis of the 2021 WSEC Residential
Provisions Final Report February 2023. The prior analysis and report were based on the energy
credits in the 2021 WSEC-R Section R406 that were published on May 27, 2022. However, the
energy credits table was later modified per the CR-103P published on January 3, 2023. The
prior report thus did not account for the revised energy credits. This report presents revised
energy savings and cost-effectiveness analyses that are amended to reflect the new R406
measures.
The state of Washington is updating their current state residential energy code. They will be
moving from the 2018 Washington State Energy Code (2018 WSEC-R) to the 2021 WSEC-R.
The Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) requested that Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory (PNNL) perform an independent analysis of the energy, economic, and emissions
impacts of the code changes between the 2018 WSEC-R and 2021 WSEC-R. The objective
was to review submitted data in the proposals, supplement and revise the economic impact
analyses included in those proposals as needed, and review life-cycle cost analyses per state
protocols or using alternative methods if necessary to provide improved and more accurate
analysis.
PNNL reviewed the proposals listed in the following table as well as the R406 code language
updates. The team analyzed a subset of these proposals and code changes using building
energy simulation with Washington-specific inputs and following the Department of Energy
(DOE) established methodology for cost-effectiveness.1 Table ES-1 illustrates all proposals
requested for analysis. For this report, proposals 1–8 were selected for the overall costeffectiveness analysis by simulating the 2021 WSEC-R. However, proposals 4 and 8 were
removed from the analysis because the SBCC voted to disapprove. PNNL reviewed proposals 9
through 16 in a qualitative analysis to provide feedback on the cost-benefit analyses provided by
the proponents.

The cost-effectiveness results for the 2021 WSEC-R compared to the 2018 WSEC-R are shown
in Table ES-2 for various metrics. Details on the simulations that were used to determine the
cost-effectiveness of each proposal in the 2021 WSEC-R can be found in the Final Cost-Benefit
Analysis of Select 2021 WSEC Residential Provisions, which was submitted to the SBCC before
this report.1 When life-cycle cost savings are positive, a code change proposal or energy code is
considered cost-effective. As shown in Table ES-2, when considering only market rate utility
costs, the 2021 WSEC-R is cost-effective with $4,568 life-cycle cost savings over the 30-year
analysis period. When the social cost of carbon (SCC) is also considered (as required by the
state of Washington), the 2021 WSEC-R improves its cost-effectiveness with total life cycle cost
savings of $5,927. The 2021 WSEC-R was found to increase electric energy consumption while
eliminating fossil fuel consumption due to the code provisions requiring electric space heating
and water heating.

The 2021 WSEC-R will result in statewide societal benefits such as cost savings, reduced
greenhouse gas emissions, and job creation. As shown in Table ES-3, Washington residents
could expect to save $2 billion in energy costs and reduce statewide CO2e emissions over 30
years by 17,050,000 metric tons, equivalent to the annual CO2e emissions of 3,708,000 cars on
the road (1 MMT CO2 = 217,480 cars driven/year).

Updating the Washington State energy code to the 2021 WSEC-R will also stimulate the
creation of high-quality jobs across the state. As outlined in Table ES-4, the impact on utility bills
and construction-related activities from adopting the 2021 WSEC-R will lead to over 10,000 jobs
created in Washington over the next 30 years.

Based on the current analysis conducted by PNNL comparing the 2021 WSEC-R to the 2018
WSEC-R, the statewide weighted average whole building energy savings of 2021 WSEC-R
relative to 2018 WSEC-R is 38.5%. As shown in Table ES-5, the energy use index for the 2018
WSEC-R compared to the 2006 WSEC-R is 60.5%. Multiplying the 60.5% energy use index
(2018 WSEC-R compared to 2006 WSEC-R) with the 38.5% savings (2021 WSEC-R relative to
2018 WSEC-R) yields a 23.3% reduction over the 2018 WSEC-R energy use index. The 2018
WSEC-R energy use index of 60.5% minus the 23.3% reduction yields the new 2021 WSEC-R
energy use index of 37.2% relative to the 2006 WSEC-R. Table ES-5 below shows the current
2021 WSEC-R energy use index compared to previous editions of the WSEC.

1.0 Introduction
The state of Washington is updating their current state residential energy code—the 2018
Washington State Energy Code (2018 WSEC-R)—to an updated 2021 WSEC-R version. This
report evaluates the life cycle and greenhouse gas emission impacts of the 2021 WSEC-R. The
Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) requested an analysis of the energy and
economic impacts of the proposed amendments to the 2018 WSEC-R. The specific request
asked Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to look at the energy and economic impact
of the 2021 WSEC-R over the 2018 WSEC-R. This report builds upon the previous report
submitted to the SBCC, Final Cost-Benefit Analysis of Select 2021 WSEC Residential
Provisions, that detailed the cost-effective analyses of individual proposals that made up the
2021 WSEC-R.1

1.1 2021 WSEC-R Proposals
PNNL reviewed the proposals listed in the following table. The team analyzed a subset of these
proposals using large-scale simulation following the DOE established methodology for costeffectiveness.2 Table 1 illustrates all proposals requested for analysis. For this report, proposals
1-8 were combined for a cost-effectiveness analysis by simulation. However, proposals 4 and 8
were removed from analysis due to the Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) vote to
disapprove. PNNL performed a qualitative review of proposals 9-16 in this report to evaluate the
cost-effective analyses provided by the proponents.

2.0 Cost-effectiveness Analysis
The PNNL analysis for the 2021 WSEC-R followed the standard modeling and costeffectiveness methodology detailed in Taylor et al. (2015).1 EnergyPlus simulations were run
using the 2018 WSEC-R as the baseline across the Washington state climate zones (4C and
5B) to estimate energy use changes, energy cost changes, and carbon emissions based on
the proposals. Single-family prototypes are 2,376 sq ft while multifamily dwelling units are
1,200 sq ft. The updated prototypes were simulated based on the new code language in each
proposal.
The WSEC-R baseline and updated prototypes included additional energy efficiency credit
requirements as required in Section R406. For the single-family prototype at 2,376 sq ft, 6.0
credits were required for the 2018 WSEC-R and 5.0 credits required for the 2021 WSEC-R. The
multifamily dwelling unit at 1,200 sq ft required 4.5 credits for both the 2018 and 2021 WSEC-R.
When a proposal required the addition of more efficiency, the energy credits in the updated
prototype were adjusted to account for the additional efficiency. The energy credits selected in
the baseline and updated prototypes are listed in Section 3.0 where the details on the analysis
for each proposal are presented.

2.1 Methodology
This section provides an overview of the methodology used in evaluating the cost-effectiveness
of the proposals for the 2021 WSEC-R compared to the 2018 WSEC-R. Cost-effectiveness
results for life cycle cost (LCC) savings, simple payback, and cash flow are calculated for each
building type in each climate zone. The results are weighted to aggregate results to the climate
zone level. Weighting factors for each of the prototype buildings were developed for all U.S.
climate zones using 2019 new residential construction starts and residential construction details
from the U.S. Census (Census 2010), the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS
2013), and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB 2009). The weights were finetuned by the revised county-to-climate zone map based on the ASHRAE 169-2013 climate zone
changes.
DOE’s cost-effectiveness methodology evaluates 32 residential prototypes comprising two
building types (single-family and low-rise multifamily), four foundation types (slab, crawl,
unheated basement, and heated basement), and four heating system types (gas furnace, oil
furnace, electric furnace, and heat pump). These prototypes are simulated with TMY3 weather
data from locations in Washington representing the two climate zones and two moisture regimes
in this analysis.
Construction cost differences between the 2018 WSEC-R and the 2021 WSEC-R for each
proposal were taken directly from DOE/PNNL reports on the cost-effectiveness of new code
editions, Home Depot and Lowes stores, as well as conversations with heat pump
manufacturers and sales representatives. National cost estimates were adjusted by a
Washington-specific construction cost multiplier2 and appropriate Consumer Price Index (CPI)
multipliers3 to bring costs into 2022 dollars.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis

3

Life Cycle Cost (LCC) savings is the primary measure used to assess the economic impact of
building energy codes. LCC is the calculation of the present value of costs over a 30-year period
including initial equipment and construction costs, energy savings, maintenance and
replacement costs, and residual value of components at the end of the 30-year period. When
the LCC of the updated code (e.g., the 2021 WSEC-R) is lower than that of the previous code
(the 2018 WSEC-R), the updated code is considered cost‐effective. In other words, when life
cycle cost savings is positive, the proposal is considered cost-effective.
The energy savings from the simulation analysis are converted to energy cost savings using the
electricity and gas prices established for analyzing Washington energy code proposals. In
addition, the oil price is the most recent state-specific residential oil price from DOE’s Energy
Information Administration. Fuel prices used in this analysis can be found in Table 2. Fuel prices
are escalated over the analysis period based on EIA’s year-by-year projections in the 2021

Per the established methodology, PNNL calculates three metrics from the perspective of the
homeowner—LCC, simple payback, and cash flow. LCC is the primary metric used by DOE and
Washington state for determining the cost-effectiveness of an overall code or individual code
change. The economic parameters used in the current cost-effectiveness analysis are
summarized in Table 3. The economic parameters are recently updated following the
established methodology to account for changing economic conditions.

An additional analysis metric required for all Washington energy code proposals is the life cycle
cost savings when including the social cost of carbon (SCC). Emission factors used in the
calculation of carbon emissions and SCC are extracted from the Carbon Externality

spreadsheet as part of the Washington Life Cycle Cost Analysis Tool version 2020-A, provided
by the Washington Office of Financial Management. Carbon emissions are based on annual fuel
consumption based on the simulation of the baseline and updated prototypes. Carbon emission
factors used in the analysis are shown in Table 4.

9.62 x 10-3 metric tons CO2/gallon

The life cycle savings of SCC is determined based on a net present value (NPV) calculation of
annual savings in the SCC over a 30-year period. The social cost of carbon is based on
estimates from the U.S. Government Interagency Working Group on SCC.1 The annual social
cost of carbon for the years 2010 to 2118 is contained in the Washington Life Cycle Cost
Analysis Tool. The annual social cost of carbon is multiplied by the annual carbon emissions
over a 30-year period to calculate the total dollar value of the carbon emissions. The NPV of
SCC is calculated with a discount rate of 5% over the 30 years of carbon emissions. The
difference in the NPV of SCC for the baseline case and updated case based on each proposal
is the NPV savings for SCC.

3.0 2021 WSEC-R Analysis Results
The following sections highlight the cost-effectiveness results and societal benefits of the
combined proposals and updated R406 code language that make up the 2021 WSEC-R. The
results consist of energy savings by fuel type, energy cost savings, construction costs, and life
cycle savings, as well as the life cycle savings of SCC. Details on the simulations to determine
the cost-effectiveness of each proposal can be found in the Final Cost-Benefit Analysis of Select
2021 WSEC Residential Provisions submitted to the SBCC before this report.

3.1 Analysis
PNNL merged proposals 1-8 together and incorporated the latest Washington code language
into one model and analyzed them as one overall code change by EnergyPlus simulation for
cost-effectiveness assessment. For the cost-effectiveness analysis of the proposals reflecting
the 2021 WSEC-R, the energy credit options used in the simulations are detailed for the
baseline case and the updated case. The PNNL single-family prototypes representing the
2021 WSEC-R have a total of 5.0 credits from section R406. The multifamily prototypes for the
2021 WSEC-R have 261 credits due to heat pump water heating which far exceeds the
commercial credit requirements of 41 for R-2 buildings in Table C406.1 of the 2021 WSEC-C.
The PNNL prototypes representing the 2018 WSEC-R baseline cases have a total of 6.0
credits and 4.5 credits for single-family and multifamily homes, respectively. The baseline
2018 WSEC-R prototypes use all four HVAC system types, while the 2021 WSEC-R
prototypes use only heat pump systems (space heating and water heating). The energy credit
options and corresponding credits values listed in the tables correspond to Table R406.3—
Energy Credits in the 2021 WSEC-R, and Table C406.2—Efficiency Measure Credits in the
2021 Commercial Washington State Energy Code, (2021 WSEC-C). The additional efficiency
options used for the 2018 and 2021 WSEC-R analyses for the baseline case and updated
case are shown in Table 5 and Table 6.

3.2 2021 WSEC-R Overall Savings and Cost-Effectiveness
For this analysis, the incremental costs for installing the code change proposals include the
avoided cost of installing the gas infrastructure in the fossil fuel prototypes. The prototypes
with electric space heating and electric water heating are fully electric and do not have any
gas infrastructure as part of the model. As a result, construction costs for the electric heating
systems do not include the avoided cost of installing the gas infrastructure because the
baseline is already fully electric. The $4,240 (single-family) and $3,151 (multifamily)
incremental cost to install a heat pump applies only to the fossil fuel and electric furnace
scenarios. It does not apply to the heat pump scenario because both the baseline and updated
code models use a heat pump. The construction costs used for the complete 2021 WSEC-R
analysis are shown below.

This cost-effectiveness analysis shows that the 2021 WSEC-R amendments to the 2018
WSEC-R will yield substantial energy and LCC savings. The individual consumer impact of the
2021 WSEC-R is reduced annual energy costs of $170, resulting in $5,927 in additional lifecycle benefits from energy cost savings and SCC savings when compared to the 2018 WSECR. LCC savings are $4,568 and LCC savings of the SCC are $1,359. The 2021 WSEC-R does
increase the energy use and cost of electricity due to the code provisions requiring space
heating and SWH be electric. The life-cycle analysis results are shown in Table 7.

3.3 2021 WSEC-R Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions
The 2021 WSEC-R will result in statewide societal benefits such as cost savings, reduced
greenhouse gas emissions, and job creation. Shown in Table 8, Washington residents could
expect to save over $2 billion in energy costs and reduce statewide CO2e emissions over 30
years by 17,050,000 metric tons, equivalent to the annual CO2e emissions of 3,708,000 cars on
the road (1 MMT CO2 = 217,480 cars driven/year).

3.4 2021 WSEC-R Jobs Impacts
Energy-efficient building codes impact job creation through two primary value streams:
1. Dollars returned to the economy through reduction in utility bills and resulting increase in
disposable income, and;
2. An increase in construction-related activities associated with the incremental cost of
construction that is required to produce a more energy efficient building.
When a building is built to a more stringent energy code, there is the long-term benefit of the
ratepayer paying lower utility bills.
•

This is partially offset by the increased cost of that efficiency, establishing a relationship
between increased building energy efficiency and additional investments in construction
activity.

•

Since building codes are cost-effective, (i.e., the savings outweigh the investment), a
real and permanent increase in wealth occurs that can be spent on other goods and
services in the economy, just like any other income, generating economic benefits and
creating additional employment opportunities.

Updating the Washington State energy code to the 2021 WSEC-R will also stimulate the
creation of high-quality jobs across the state. As outlined in Table 9, the impact on utility bills
and construction-related activities from adopting the 2021 WSEC-R will lead to over 10,000 jobs
created in Washington over the next 30 years.

3.5 2021 WSEC-R Percent Reduction in Energy Use over 2006
WSEC-R
As shown in Table 10 on the following page, the simulated energy use index for the 2018
WSEC-R compared to the 2006 WSEC-R is 60.5%. The energy use index of 60.5% indicates
that the 2018 WSEC-R is 39.5% more efficient than the 2006 WSEC-R. This data is based on
prior analyses by Ecotope and O’Brien360.
Based on the current analysis conducted by PNNL comparing the 2021 WSEC-R to the 2018
WSEC-R, the statewide weighted average whole building energy savings of 2021 WSEC-R
relative to 2018 WSEC-R is 38.5%. Multiplying the 60.5% energy use index (2018 WSEC-R
compared to 2006 WSEC-R) with the 38.5% savings (2021 WSEC-R relative to 2018 WSEC-R)
yields a 23.3% reduction over the 2018 WSEC-R energy use index. The 2018 WSEC-R energy
use index of 60.5% minus the 23.3% reduction yields the new 2021 WSEC-R energy use index
of 37.2% relative to the 2006 WSEC-R.
In other words, a newly constructed residential building that minimally complies with the 2021
WSEC-R is expected to have 37.2% energy use intensity compared to a building that minimally
complies with the 2006 WSEC-R, assuming in this example the building’s energy use matches
the statewide weighted average energy use. This means that the new residential building will
use 62.8% less energy than a home built to the provisions of the 2006 WSEC-R. Table 10 on
the following page shows the current 2021 WSEC-R energy use index compared to previous
editions of the WSEC.

4.0 Individual Proposal Analyses (Qualitative)
In this section, the cost-effectiveness analyses conducted for 2021 WSEC-R code change
proposals 9 through 18 by the proponents are reviewed to determine if the quantification of
energy and cost savings are plausible. This qualitative review is for the 2021 WSEC-R code
change proposals that cannot be analyzed by simulation because they fit outside the normal
functions of the PNNL prototype buildings and infrastructure. The reviews take a qualitative look
at the cost-benefit analysis provided by the code change proponents and provide feedback if
any necessary changes are required.

4.1 Proposal 9: Additions (21-GP2-073 – review only)
Proposal 21-GP2-073 for home additions adds an exemption that could be used by the authority
having jurisdiction (AHJ) when a small addition has an undue burden (cost incurred by structural
hindrances, real-life practicality of install, or overly costly requirements with little to no benefit)
trying to achieve the R406.2 or R406.3 credit requirements.

4.1.1

Proposed Code Language for Additions

R502.1 General. Additions to an existing building, building system, or portion thereof shall
conform to the provisions of this code because those provisions relate to new construction
without requiring the unaltered portion of the existing building or building system to comply with
this code except as specified in this chapter. Additions shall not create unsafe or hazardous
conditions or overload existing building systems. An addition shall be deemed compliant with
this code when the addition alone complies, when the existing building and addition comply with
this code as a single building, or when the building with the addition uses no more energy than
the existing building. Additions shall be in accordance with Section R502.1.1 or R502.1.2.
R502.1.1 Small additions. Additions not greater than 150 square feet (13.9 m2) shall not be
required to comply with Section R406.
R502.3 Prescriptive compliance. Additions shall comply with Sections R502.3.1 through
R502.3.4.
R502.3.1 Building envelope. New building envelope assemblies that are part of the
addition shall comply with Sections R402.1, R402.2, R402.3.1 through R402.3.5, and
R402.4.
R502.3.1.1 Existing ceilings with attic spaces. Where an addition greater than 150
square feet (13.9 m2) adjoins existing ceilings with attic spaces, the existing attic spaces
shall comply with Section R402.
R502.3.2 Heating and cooling systems. HVAC ducts newly installed as part of an addition
shall comply with Section R403.
Exception: The following need not comply with the testing requirements of Section R403.3.3:
1. Additions of less than 150 square feet.
2. Duct systems that are documented to have been previously sealed as confirmed through
field verification and diagnostic testing in accordance with procedures in WSU RS-33.
3. Existing duct systems constructed, insulated, or sealed with asbestos.

4.1.2

Review

The code change proposal mentions that there would be no cost impact to exempt additions
less than or equal to 150 sq ft (13.9 m2) from the additional credit requirements. The purpose of
the exemption is to alleviate cost burdens of Section R406 additional efficiency credits for very
small additions. For very small projects (additions) with minimal impact on energy use, requiring
additional efficiency items would prove an undue financial burden on the homeowners. The
potential costs of the additional efficiency requirements could potentially be much larger than
the cost of the addition itself. In effect, this proposal would result in overall cost savings without
the requirement of the additional R406 efficiency credits.
For the 2021 WSEC-R, an addition between 100 and 500 sq ft would require 2 credits of
additional efficiency built in for the entire home.
The following are energy credit examples from Table R406.3 and associated potential
construction costs:
• Option 1.6: 30% UA reduction in the envelope insulation ($5,000)
• Option 2.3: Reduced air leakage to 0.6 ACH50 ($3,600)
• Option 3.6: Ductless minisplit system ($3,060)
• Option 5.4: NEEA Tier III hot water heating system ($1,900)
Each of the above examples would result in a significant cost for a small (150 sq ft or less)
addition to a home. The cost savings of not requiring additional efficiency would be substantial.
The proposal to add an exemption from the additional efficiency requirements for small
additions appears valid because those costs could overshadow the costs of the addition itself.
An additional benefit of this code change proposal is less inspection time and permitting
requirements for the AHJ. To run a cost-effectiveness analysis of residential additions to a home
is outside the scope of the PNNL residential infrastructure and was not analyzed through
simulation.

4.2 Proposal 10: Testing Agency Certification (21-GP2-088 – review
only)
In the 2018 WSEC-R, any code official may require that air leakage testing be conducted by a
third-party testing agency. Code change proposal 21-GP2-088 for testing agency certification
improves the quality and consistency of the third-party testing agency by specifying the
minimum credentials that testing agencies must have. To improve accuracy and accountability,
this proposal also requires that the testing report include location verification and a time stamp
of the date of the air leakage test.

4.2.1

Testing Agency Certification Proposed Code Language

R402.4.1.2 Testing. The building or dwelling unit shall be tested for air leakage. The maximum
air leakage rate for any building or dwelling unit under any compliance path shall not exceed 5.0
air changes per hour. Testing shall be conducted with a blower door at a pressure of 0.2 inches
w.g. (50 pascals). For this test only, the volume of the home shall be the conditioned floor area
in ft2 (m2) multiplied by 8.5 feet (2.6 m). Where required by the code official, air leakage testing
shall be conducted by an approved third party. A written report of the test results, including

Individual Proposal Analyses (Qualitative)

13

verified location and time stamp of the date of the test, shall be signed by the testing agency
and provided to the building owner and code official. Testing shall be performed at any time
after creation of all penetrations of the building thermal envelope. Once visual inspection has
confirmed that air sealing has been conducted in accordance with Table R402.4.1.1, operable
windows and doors manufactured by a small business are permitted to be sealed off at the
frame before the test.
Testing of single-family dwellings and townhouses shall be conducted in accordance with
RESNET/ICC 380. The test pressure and leakage rate shall comply with Section R402.4.1.3.
For Group R-2 occupancies, testing shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM E779, ASTM
E1827, or ASTM E3158. The individual performing the air leakage test shall be trained and
certified by a certification body that is, at the time of permit application, an ISO 17024 accredited
certification body, including but not limited to the Air Barrier Association of America.

4.2.2

Review

Proposal 21-GP2-088 for air leakage testing agency certification is primarily editorial in nature to
improve the quality and consistency of the third-party testing agency’s credentials. No
assumption is made that clarifying the third-party testing qualifications would improve the air
tightness of the home or the accuracy of the testing results. Simulation analysis would assume
that the home meets the air sealing and testing requirements of Section R402.4.1.2 and that as
a result, no energy or cost impacts would occur. This proposal would have no simulated energy
impact.

4.3 Proposal 11: Service Water Heating Circulation Control (21-GP2071 – review only)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-071 for service water heating (SWH) circulation control aims to
reduce the amount of energy required to maintain prompt delivery of service hot water to
plumbing fixtures by optimizing the circulation system pump controls. The purpose of an SWH
circulation system is to reduce the amount of time required to provide hot water to the furthest
fixture. However, controls are needed to minimize circulation pump operation when there is no
demand for hot water. This is particularly important in buildings with a central SWH system.
This proposal requires electronically commutated motors (ECMs) for SWH circulation pumps in
Group R-2 buildings where a central SWH system serves multiple dwelling units. Circulation
pumps with ECMs offer improved energy savings compared to circulation pumps with standard
induction motors. The ECM motor requirement aligns with the 2021 WSEC-C requirements. In
addition, this proposal requires that the system return pipe in a circulation system be a
dedicated return pipe rather than a cold-water pipe to reduce heat energy loss in the system.

4.3.1

Service Water Heating Circulation Control Proposed Code Language

R403.5.1 Heated water circulation and temperature maintenance systems. Heated water
circulation systems shall be in accordance with Section R403.5.1.1. Heat trace temperature
maintenance systems shall be in accordance with Section R403.5.1.2. Automatic controls,
temperature sensors, and pumps shall be in an accessible location. Manual controls shall be in
a readily accessible location.

Individual Proposal Analyses (Qualitative)

14

R403.5.1.1 Circulation systems. Heated water circulation systems shall be provided with a
circulation pump. The system return pipe shall be a dedicated return pipe. Gravity and
thermosiphon circulation systems are prohibited. Controls shall automatically turn off the
circulation pump when the water in the circulation loop is at the desired temperature and
when there is no demand for hot water.
R403.5.1.1.1 Demand recirculation water systems serving an individual dwelling
unit. Where installed, demand recirculation water systems shall have controls that start
the pump upon receiving a signal from the action of a fixture or appliance user, sensing
the presence of a fixture user, or sensing the flow of hot or tempered water to a fixture
fitting or appliance.

4.3.2

Review

The proponent of the SWH circulation control proposal states that one of the purposes of the
proposed code language is to require ECMs in circulation pumps in Group R-2 buildings.
However, the code change proposal contains no language toward requiring ECMs for the
circulation pumps. The only significant code change with this proposal is removing the
allowance of the cold-water supply pipe as an option for a return pipe. The remainder of the
code change proposal was editorial. The proponent claims that having ECM motors in the
circulation pumps will save 120 kWh/year due to the increased motor efficiency with an
estimated 4,000 hours of operation. While the circulation pump motor energy savings based on
the hours of pump operation is correct, the hours of operation seem excessive given the level of
control required in the energy code. This assumption would mean the pumps run 11 hours per
day every day of the year. Without any control, a circulation pump will run 8,760 hours per year.
While there is no standard or measure of average circulation pump operational time, better
circulation controls will reduce circulation pump and water heating time.
The proponent claims that the incremental first cost for a circulation pump with an ECM motor is
$250, which appears to be a correct assumption. There are many circulation pumps for
residential hot water circulation on the market in the $300 range. It is not clear if the ECM
requirement was overlooked in the code proposal or removed accidentally. Given the claim that
ECM motors save 20% over a standard induction motor, the energy savings generated would
be higher if the motor had a longer operational time, which the circulation controls will work to
reduce. Given the small pump energy savings of the ECM motor for the circulation pump and
improved circulation control, there will be energy savings compared to a standard induction
motor without circulation control. However, there appears to be no ECM motor requirement in
the code change proposal, so savings will only occur from circulation control.
Per consultation with members of the PNNL Appliance Standards team, the claim that a
dedicated hot water return pipe in a circulation system can reduce heat energy loss versus
allowing a cold-water pipe to be used as the return is true. The heat loss reduction would be
small and may not make a sufficient difference in energy use for service hot water. Calculating
the savings could be complicated because there are many variables to consider in a residential
setting, such as hot water demand profiles, fixture flow rates, and pipe length to the furthest
fixture. Finally, allowing tepid water to flow into the domestic cold-water supply pipes could
contribute to Legionella growth and introduction of dissolved metals from the hot water heater
into the cold-water supply distribution piping.

4.4 Proposal 12: Energy Credit Options 3.1 and 3.2 (21-GP2-034 –
review only)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-034 provides a new connected thermostat credit option (Option
3.7) for Table R406.3—Energy Credits in the 2021 WSEC-R. Option 3.7 of the High Efficiency
HVAC Equipment Options section rewards a connected thermostat with 0.5 energy credits.
Connected thermostat credit savings apply to gas furnaces (natural gas or propane) and central
hydronic boiler systems (Option 3.1), as well as central ducted forced air heat pumps (Option
3.2). The connected thermostat must be on the ENERGY STAR Certified Smart Thermostats
list.1
The proponent of this code change proposal makes the following claims:
• Provides additional options for saving energy that are cost-effective (4-year simple payback)
• Provides builder and occupant flexibility to meet energy credits.
• Improves HVAC contractor compliance with R403.1 controls.
• Reduces AHJ workload.
The proponent provides additional benefits for occupant, utility, and climate goals related to the
following:
• Utility demand response.
• HVAC fault detection.
• Occupant and/or service technician maintenance and operation.
• IoT platform for saving additional energy from:
–

Miscellaneous electric loads, ground fault interrupters, garage doors, smart plugs.

–

Lighting.

–

Appliances.

–

Smart ventilation.

–

Shutting off equipment besides HVAC when not needed (daily, weekly, or vacation
modes).

Review

The proponent stated that ENERGY STAR connected thermostats cost about $200 (after 35%
markup from the contractor to the owner) which matches cost estimates from a PNNL technical
brief: Demand Response in Residential Energy Code.1 ENERGY STAR claims that connected
thermostats will save 8% on heating and cooling bills or $50 per year.2 According to the
ENERGY STAR page for connected thermostats:
“Savings from ENERGY STAR smart thermostats and the test method used to determine
these savings are closely tied together. Together with interested stakeholders, EPA created
a repeatable test procedure that determines whether or not a smart thermostat meets a
minimum threshold of HVAC savings (e.g., percent runtime reductions) compared to the
installed base of all other thermostats in the United States. The test method defines an
auditable process to select a sample of homes spread across the country. It also specifies
how to use EPA-provided software to analyze a year of data from each sample home and to
aggregate the data from all homes. The results are submitted to a third-party certification
body. This process ensures that savings aren’t simply the effects of regional overrepresentation. ENERGY STAR smart thermostats save energy – regardless of climate
zone.”
According to the proponent, consumer annual savings are expected to be roughly $30–
$60/year, giving a simple payback between 4 to 8 years over a 15-year useful life. Based on
ENERGY STAR expected savings with a connected thermostat, these results are plausible.
Additional heat pump savings from connected thermostats can be realized from improved
supplemental electric resistance heat lockout controls above 35 °F. AHJ field verifications

typically do not include the scope of verifying the control settings. In addition, many HVAC
contractors do not adjust from non-lockout electric resistance mode to lockout controls above
35 °F mode. The lockout control algorithms in many EPA connected thermostats will result in
more realized savings for single-speed heat pumps with 10–15 kW of strip heat. There will be
no time impact for the AHJs, who typically do not have time to verify if a connected thermostat is
in place.

4.5 Proposal 13: Cold Climate Heat Pump – Table R406.3 Option 3.2
(21-GP2-023)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-023 requires the installation of a cold climate heat pump in
areas where the winter design temperature is less than 23 °F to claim credit for R406.3 Option
3.2 for centrally ducted heat pumps. If the home is constructed in a colder climate zone, it must
install a Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership (NEEP) qualified cold climate heat pump.
Using cold climate heat pumps can significantly reduce electric consumption over standard heat
pumps with strip heat supplemental systems. This change will encourage the use of cold climate
heat pumps and reduce the need for large supplemental heat systems with heat pumps.

4.5.1

Cold Climate Heat Pump Option 3.2 Proposed Code Language

3.2a Air-source centrally ducted heat pump with a minimum HSPF of 9.5. In areas where the
winter design temperature as specified in WAC 51-11C-80100 is 23 °F or below, a cold climate
heat pump found on the NEEP code climate ASHP qualified product list shall be used. NEEP
cold climate heat pump list can be found here: https://neep.org/heatingelectrification/ccashpspecification-product-list.
To qualify to claim this credit, the building permit drawings shall specify the option being
selected and shall specify the heating equipment type, and the minimum equipment efficiency.
a. An alternative heating source sized at a maximum of 0.5 watts/ft2 (equivalent) of heated floor area or 500 watts,
whichever is bigger, may be installed in the dwelling unit.

4.5.2

Review

The original code change proposal allowed a 9.0 HSPF cold climate heat pump to qualify for the
Option 3.2 credit, which requires a 9.5 HSPF standard heat pump. The final version of the
proposal requires a 9.5 HSPF cold climate heat pump in regions where the winter design
temperature is less than 23 °F. According to NEEPs Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump
Specification (Version 4.0),1 a central air-conditioning heat pump must have a COP greater than
or equal to 1.75 at 5 °F during maximum capacity operation. A cold climate heat pump will serve
space heating from the compressor at lower temperatures than the standard heat pump and
thus use less electric backup resistance heat.
The proponent claimed that the incremental cost of switching from a 9.5 HSPF standard heat
pump to a cold climate heat pump at 9.0 HSPF would be less than $1,000. The proponent also
claimed that cold climate heat pumps do not need electric resistance backup heat (estimated
cost: $550 for material and labor), an electrical connection for strip heat (estimated cost: $200
for material and labor), or a strip heat lock out kit (estimated cost: $250 for material and labor).

Total estimated savings from avoided accessories with a cold climate heat pump total $1,000.
The net cost increase to go from a standard heat pump plus supplemental accessories to a cold
climate heat pump that does not require these accessories is estimated at less than $1,000 per
dwelling (≤ $2,000 increased cost for cold climate heat pump minus $1,000 avoided accessory
cost for supplemental heat accessories). The proponent is not clear on whether the incremental
cost is due to switching from a 9.5 HSPF to a 9.0 HSPF cold climate heat pump or switching to
an equal-efficiency cold climate heat pump. Even though a cold climate heat pump will have
higher capacities at lower air temperatures than a standard heat pump, there will be insufficient
heating capacity to meet the heating load. Thus, completely removing the backup heating
system would be inadvisable. The incremental construction costs seem plausible, but it is
advisable to estimate the incremental cost at $2000 to cover the electric backup resistance
heating.
The original cost-effectiveness analysis conducted by the proponent showed that a 9.0 HSPF
cold climate heat pump would save $410 in electric costs from removing electric resistance
backup heating alone. No simulated or estimated operational cost savings from the heat pump
compressors were submitted. While it may be possible to reduce the electric resistance backup
heating for a cold climate heat pump, it would not be advisable to remove it completely. As a
result, cost savings from a smaller-capacity electric resistance system would be lower than the
estimated $410. PNNL conducted a simulation analysis comparing a 9.5 HSPF standard heat
pump to a 9.5 HSPF cold climate heat pump in climate zone 5B. The cold climate heat pump
utilized performance curves developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) based on
performance data from market-available heat pumps. The results (aggregated over all
foundation types) showed the cold climate heat pump reduced total energy use in a singlefamily home by 14.1% and in a multifamily dwelling unit by 5.5%. This equates to electric annual
energy savings of 2,377 kWh and annual energy cost savings of $230 for a single-family home,
and annual energy savings of 484 kWh and cost savings of $48 for a multifamily dwelling unit.
The cold climate heat pump saved over 37% of heating energy in the single-family home
because more heating was served by the compressor than by the electric resistance backup
heating. The multifamily dwelling unit showed annual heating energy reduction of 24% with a
cold climate heat pump. The residential simulation infrastructure does not have the ability to
aggregate electric backup heating consumption, but one case showed that the standard heat
pump used 5,200 kWh of backup heating while the cold climate heat pump backup heat
consumed only 51 kWh in a single-family home.
The electric resistance heating capacity in the simulation models were auto-sized by
EnergyPlus based on climate and compressor capacity. As a result, both heat pumps had the
same size electric backup heating capacity due to similar sized heat pumps and the same
climate. Because the cold climate heat pump could supply more heating capacity at lower air
temperatures, it ran the electric resistance heating less frequently than the standard heat pump.
Cold climate heat pump savings will occur from more efficient compressor operation at lower
temperatures as well as reduced backup resistance heating consumption.

4.6 Proposal 14: Cold Climate Heat Pump – Table R406.3 Option 3.5
(21-GP2-024)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-024 requires the installation of a NEEP-listed cold climate heat
pump rated at 10.0 HSPF to obtain additional efficiency credits for Option 3.5 in areas with a
heating design temperature below 23 °F. Option 3.5 of Table R406.3 mandates a standard
centrally ducted air-source heat pump with an HSPF of 11.0. The use of cold climate heat

pumps can significantly reduce electric consumption over standard heat pumps with strip heat
supplemental systems. Cold climate heat pumps have slightly lower HSPF ratings due to defrost
cycles and base pan heaters. This change will encourage the use of cold climate heat pumps
and reduce the need for large supplemental heat systems with standard centrally ducted airsource heat pumps.

4.6.1

Cold Climate Heat Pump Option 3.5 Proposed Code Language

Option 3.5a: Air-source centrally ducted heat pump with minimum HSPF of 11.0. In areas where
the winter design temperature as specified in WAC 51-11C-80100 is 23 °F or below, an airsource heat pump serving a centrally ducted system shall be a cold climate variable capacity
heat pump as defined in the NEEP cold climate heat pump list, with a minimum HSPF of 10.0.
To qualify to claim this credit, the building permit drawings shall specify the option being
selected and shall specify the heating equipment type and the minimum equipment efficiency.
a. An alternative heating source sized at a maximum of 0.5 watts/ft2 (equivalent) of heated floor area or 500 watts,
whichever is bigger, may be installed in the dwelling unit.

4.6.2

Review

This review shows similar results to those for code change proposal 21-GP2-023 for a 9.5
HSPF cold climate heat pump. For this case, the proponent claims that the incremental cost of
switching from an 11.0 HSPF standard air-source heat pump to a cold climate heat pump of
10.0 HSPF is less than $2,500. The proponent also claimed that cold climate heat pumps do not
require electric resistance backup heat (estimated cost: $550 for material and labor), electrical
connections for strip heat (estimated cost: $200 material and labor), or strip heat lock out kits
(estimated cost: $250 material and labor). Total estimated savings from avoided electric backup
heating accessories with a cold climate heat pump are $1,000. Net cost increase to go from a
standard heat pump plus supplemental accessories to a cold climate heat pump that does not
require these accessories is estimated to be less than $1,500 per dwelling unit (≤ $2,500
increased cost for a cold climate heat pump minus $1,000 avoided accessory cost for
supplemental heat accessories). The incremental costs seem plausible, but it is better to
estimate the incremental cost of a cold climate heat pump at $2,500 to cover the electric backup
resistance heating.
The cost-benefit analysis conducted by the proponent showed that a 10.0 HSPF cold climate
heat pump would save $410 in annual electric costs by removing electric resistance backup
heat. While it may be feasible to reduce the electric resistance backup heating for a cold climate
heat pump, it would not be advisable to remove it completely. Based on the PNNL cold climate
heat pump simulations described below, annual energy cost savings from the reduced use of
the backup heating system are significant.
PNNL conducted a simulation analysis comparing an 11.0 HSPF standard heat pump to a 10.0
HSPF cold climate heat pump in climate zone 5B. The cold climate heat pumps utilized
performance curves developed by ORNL based on performance data from market-available
heat pumps. The results (aggregated over all foundation types) showed the cold climate heat
pump reduced total energy use in a single-family home by 14.0% and a multifamily dwelling unit
by 5.5%. This equates to annual electric energy savings of 2,365 kWh and annual energy cost
savings of $228 for a single-family home, and annual energy savings of 475 kWh and cost
savings of $46 for a multifamily dwelling unit. The cold climate heat pump saved over 38% of

annual heating energy in the single-family home because more space heating was served by
the compressor than by the electric resistance backup heat. The multifamily dwelling unit
showed annual heating energy reduction of 24.1% with a cold climate heat pump.
The residential simulation infrastructure does not have the ability to aggregate electric backup
heating consumption. However, one case showed the standard heat pump used 5,199 kWh of
backup heating while the cold climate heat pump backup consumed only 51 kWh in a singlefamily home. These results matched up closely with those from proposal 13 because they had
the same electric resistance backup heat and compressor capacities but different seasonal
efficiencies.

4.7 Proposal 15: Cold Climate Heat Pump – Table R406.3 Option 3.6
(21-GP2-025 – review only)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-025 provides an exception to Table R406.3 Option 3.6 for
ductless minisplit systems to allow smaller multi-zone minisplit systems to be installed for
dwelling units with a design heat load less than 24 kBtuh nominal. The current language for
Option 3.6 requires a ductless minisplit system heat pump with no electric resistance and a
minimum HSPF rating of 10. The code change proposal adds an exception for a home with a
heating load of 24,000 Btuh, which can use a multi-zone minisplit system with a 9.0 HSPF for
full credit.

4.7.1

Multi-Zone Minisplit Heat Pump Option 3.6 Proposed Code Language

Option 3.6a: Ductless split system heat pumps with no electric resistance in the primary living
areas. A ductless heat pump system with a minimum HSPF of 10 shall be sized and installed to
provide heat to the entire dwelling unit at the design outdoor air temperature.
Exception: In homes with total heating loads of 24,000 Btuh or less using multi-zone minisplit
systems with nominal ratings of 24,000 Btuh or less, the minimum HSPF to claim this credit
shall be 9 HSPF.
a. An alternative heating source sized at a maximum of 0.5 watts/ft2 (equivalent) of heated floor area or 500 watts,
whichever is bigger, may be installed in the dwelling unit.

4.7.2

Review

In the reason statement for this code change proposal, the proponent claims that in the AirConditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) database of multi-zone heat pump
systems, all manufacturers have lower HSPF ratings for smaller-size multi-zone systems.
Because smaller multi-zone minisplit systems have lower HSPF ratings, builders of small homes
may consider using multiple single-zone systems to meet the 10 HSPF requirement. In many of
these homes, small multi-zone systems are a better choice for cost-effective HVAC design.
Some of these small homes with a design load under 24 kBtuh may not have adequate room to
install multiple outdoor compressors. Installing multiple outdoor compressors will create a more
expensive heat pump system due to increased material and labor costs. This code change will
encourage small sustainable homes and cost-effective HVAC design with properly sized multizone minisplit systems.
The proponent claims that material and labor costs for multi-zone minisplit installations on
smaller homes may be lower than those for installing 2–4 single-zone minisplit systems. Each

additional outdoor unit installation has an approximate cost of $1,000 in material and labor
(exclusive of the compressor costs). In this scenario, there would typically be 1–2 additional
heat pump compressor installations avoided per small home by installing an appropriately sized
multi-zone minisplit system. The avoided cost estimate would typically be $1,500 (1.5 × $1,000)
in cost savings per average home.
When comparing a multi-zone minisplit system at 9 HSPF to two single-zone minisplit systems,
there is a negligible difference in energy use. However, in homes where there are three singlezone minisplit systems at 10 HSPF rather than a multi-zone minisplit system at 9 HSPF, there
can be significant energy use advantages of using the multi-zone system. The energy use
difference depends on where on the performance curves these systems operate during the
year. Both systems might perform equally well given they are inverter-driven compressor
systems that match the load of the building. Without direct energy simulation of each of these
scenarios, it is difficult to prove the energy savings of the multi-zone system over the singlezone systems. The PNNL residential infrastructure is not capable of simulating multi-zone
systems at this time. However, the argument that a multi-zone system would have a lower
construction cost than multiple single-zone minisplit systems is plausible. It is possible that the
multi-zone system would have more piping costs, but having one compressor is a cost saver. A
home with a total design heating load of 24 kBtuh will not consume much heating energy, so
savings might be minimal no matter how many single-zone minisplit systems are considered or
installed.

4.8 Proposal 16: R406 Option 3.7 (21-GP2-050 – review only)
Code change proposal 21-GP2-050 adds a new additional efficiency option for air-to-water heat
pumps rated with a COP. The code change proposal creates a new Table R406.3 Option 3.7 for
an air-to-water heat pump with a minimum COP of 3.2 at 47 °F in accordance with AHRI
Standard 550/590. The purpose behind the code change is to remove the current barrier for
high-efficiency cold climate air-to-water heat pumps in residential sizes. These units are
currently excluded from achieving Option 3 credits despite their high efficiency because they are
only rated using COP. The COP efficiency allows credit for air-to-water heat pumps that are not
rated with an HSPF. The new Option 3.7 rewards 1.5 credits for an air-to-water heat pump that
meets the minimum COP requirement.

4.8.1

R406 Option 3.6 Proposed Code Language

Option 3.: Air-to-water heat pump with a minimum COP of 3.2 at 47 °F, rated in accordance
with AHRI 550/590 by an accredited or certified testing lab. 1.5 credits.

4.8.2

Review

The proponent claims energy savings could be achieved regionally by removing the current
barrier to high-efficiency cold climate air-to-water heat pumps (reverse chillers) in residential
sizes. These units are currently excluded from achieving Option 3 credits despite their high
efficiency because of the requirement for an HSPF rating. This provides a high-efficiency
electric option for homeowners wanting a hydronic, radiant system when natural gas is not
available.

The proponent provided unit costs for various sizes of cold climate air-to-water heat pumps per
the Arctic Energy website, which shows first costs between $4,000 and $6,000.1 The standard
electric resistance boiler used as a baseline can be in the range of $2,000–3,000 for similar
sizes. This gives an incremental cost for the air-to-water heat pump of roughly $2,500. Given
that the air-to-water heat pump would also cover cooling, construction costs would be reduced
for the installation of an air conditioner.
The proponent utilized an hourly UA load analysis (Q = UA x (Tin – Tout)) to estimate an energy
savings of 5.8 kWh per square foot of floor area. For a 2,376 square foot home, this would
equate to 13,780 kWh of energy savings. The PNNL prototype models do not include air-towater heat pump hydronic systems. However, the electric resistance furnace prototype (fully
electric), which operates with a COP of 1.0 (similar to an electric boiler), consumes an average
of 15,360 kWh annually in Washington climate zones. The space heating electric consumption
is 4,034 kWh—switching to an air-to-water heat pump system with a COP of 3.2 would thus
save approximately 2,700 kWh per year. This is far from the proponent’s estimate of 13,780
kWh in savings for a single-family prototype. The 2,700 kWh energy savings equates to $261 of
annual energy cost savings.
While the electric savings claimed by the proponent might be overstated, the energy savings of
2,700 kWh and corresponding annual energy cost savings of $261 over an electric boiler are
substantial. Any air-to-water heat pump with a COP greater than 3.2 would generate additional
energy savings. This proposal makes economic sense and removes a barrier to allowing air-towater heat pumps with efficiencies rated using COP.
