using the AVFoundation framework.

1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Information,
structure, and relationships conveyed through
presentation can be programmatically
determined or are available in text.

Supports

1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence: When the
sequence in which content is presented
affects its meaning, a correct reading
sequence can be programmatically
determined.

Supports

1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions
provided for understanding and operating
content do not rely solely on sensory
characteristics of components such as shape,
size, visual location, orientation, or sound.

Supports

macOS assistive technologies provide many alternatives for
communicating sensory information, including color filters and screen
tinting for conveying color information. Users can also increase contrast
to help distinguish between foreground and background colors.
The Accessibility API also allows third-party developers to provide
alternative characteristics for components including sound, size, and
orientation.
Page 3 of 47

1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the
only visual means of conveying information,
indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element.

Supports with
exceptions

macOS uses color to convey information. In many cases, when color is
used, it provides an alternative information display that does not rely on
color. For example, color controls are used in the title bar of macOS
windows that allow a user to close, minimize or maximize a window.
While color indicates each control s function, each control also has a
unique symbol and position that indicates its function without relying on
color information. But, there are some visual elements that do not include
an alternative information display.
macOS also provides system-level control of display characteristics that
cannot be overridden by applications, including options to:
• Switch the display from color to grayscale
• Use a display color filter or color tint
• Invert light and dark colors displayed on the screen
• Differentiate certain elements without color
• Increase contrast of elements on the screen
• Reduce the transparency of elements on the screen
•Dim Flashing Lights to automatically darkens the display of video during
sequences of ashing lights
•Pause Animated Images to pause images with animations and
movement, e.g. GIFs, in apps such as Messages and Safari
All of these features are accessed through System Settings for
Accessibility and can be used together in different combinations to suit
the user s needs.

1.4.2 Audio Control: If any audio on a Web
page plays automatically for more than 3
seconds, either a mechanism is available to
pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is
available to control audio volume
independently from the overall system volume
level.

Supports

By default, Safari stops auto-play of media with sound for websites.
There is also an option in Safari to never auto-play media when visiting
websites.
In addition, the default media player provided by WebKit supports pause
and resume, as well as controlling audio volume independently from the
overall system volume. Third-party web developers may also implement
custom controls that meet the audio control requirements.

2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the
content is operable through a keyboard
interface without requiring speci c timings for
individual keystrokes, except where the
underlying function requires input that
depends on the path of the user's movement
and not just the endpoints.

Supports

macOS provides keyboard access to operating system interface
elements using a feature called “full keyboard access” which controls
the keyboard cursor. Full keyboard access can be used to navigate the
system including menus, windows, palettes, controls, text boxes, lists,
window drawers, and status menus. In certain circumstances, VoiceOver
may be used in conjunction with full keyboard access to navigate the
system.
macOS supports use of standard USB input devices including PC-style
keyboards. For full accessibility, some macOS apps may require use of
these additional keyboard support features:
• User-Selectable keyboard layouts include QWERTY, Dvorak, Dvorak
Right, Dvorak Left, and many international languages.
• Customizable keyboard commands allow users to assign a keyboard
combination to any menu item that doesn t already have one assigned
or change an existing combination, for a specific application or for the
entire system.
• Assignable Modifier Keys allows users to turn off and reassign key
modifier functions like Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command to
other modifier keys.
• Single key Quick Nav allows users to Assign VoiceOver commands to
single keys for browsing the web using VoiceOver.
• NumPad Commander is a VoiceOver feature that enables a user to
navigate and control the computer using a numeric keypad.
• Sticky Keys, designed to allow a series of single key presses to be
interpreted as a multiple keystroke combination. Sticky Keys is
beneficial for people who have difficulty pressing multiple keys
simultaneously.
Slow Keys, designed to put a delay between when a key is pressed
and when it is accepted by the system. Slow Keys is beneficial for
people who may press keys accidentally and often. Click key sounds
are also available to provide additional feedback when a key is
accepted.
• Mouse Keys, designed to allow control of the mouse cursor from the
keyboard.
• Adjustable keyboard repeat delay, designed to prevent accidental
entry of multiple single keystrokes. The setting is adjustable and can
be set to not repeat.

2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: If keyboard focus
can be moved to a component of the page
using a keyboard interface, then focus can be
moved away from that component using only
a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more
than unmodi ed arrow or tab keys or other
standard exit methods, the user is advised of
the method for moving focus away.

Supports

macOS provides a way to navigate from a focused item, such as a popovers, dialogs, sheets and more.
If a user encounters a keyboard focus trap, they may use a variety of
tools and utilities to reset or control the keyboard focus. Full Keyboard
Access, Head Pointer, Mouse Keys, VoiceOver, Voice Control, and Switch
Control provide ways to control the focus without requiring the ability to
operate a pointing device such as a mouse.

2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts: If a
keyboard shortcut is implemented in content
using only letter (including upper- and lowercase letters), punctuation, number, or symbol
characters, then at least one of the following
is true:
• Turn off: A mechanism is available to turn
the shortcut off;
• Remap: A mechanism is available to remap
the shortcut to use one or more nonprintable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt,
etc);
• Active only on focus: The keyboard shortcut
for a user interface component is only active
when that component has focus.

2.2.1 Timing Adjustable: For each time limit
that is set by the content, at least one of the
instances in WCAG 2.0 2.2.1 is true.
• Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the
time limit before encountering it; or
• Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the
time limit before encountering it over a wide
range that is at least ten times the length of
the default setting; or

Supports with
exceptions

There are limited macOS controls over time limits. However, macOS
provides an energy saver preference for turning off the display after a
range of time including “Never”. macOS also allows for a screen saver
which can act as a warning that the computer will be put to sleep.
macOS also offers Pause Animated Images, or the option to pause
images with animations and movement, e.g. GIFs, in apps such as
Messages and Safari to suit viewing comfort.
Please note: the timing of Bluetooth pairing sessions is limited by the
Bluetooth specification and Bluetooth devices.

• Extend: The user is warned before time
expires and given at least 20 seconds to
extend the time limit with a simple action (for
example, "press the space bar"), and the
user is allowed to extend the time limit at
least ten times; or
• Real-time Exception: The time limit is a
required part of a real-time event (for
example, an auction), and no alternative to
the time limit is possible; or
• Essential Exception: The time limit is
essential and extending it would invalidate
the activity; or
• 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer
than 20 hours.

Moving, blinking, scrolling: For any
moving, blinking or scrolling information
that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more
than ve seconds, and (3) is presented in
parallel with other content, there is a
mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or
hide it unless the movement, blinking, or
scrolling is part of an activity where it is
essential; and

macOS offers Dim Flashing Lights to enable users who are sensitive to
bright ashes of light to watch video content more comfortably; it
automatically darkens the display of video during sequences of ashing
lights so the user is not exposed to potentially risky content.
Further, macOS offers Pause Animated Images, or the option to pause
images with animations and movement, e.g. GIFs, in apps such as
Messages and Safari to suit viewing comfort.
macOS also includes an accessibility setting called Reduce motion. This
setting allows users to further disable or reduce additional types of
movement.
Third-party developers should follow macOS Human Interface Guidelines
(HIG) for animation and respect the user’s Dim Flashing Lights, Pause
Animated Images, and Reduce Motion settings.

Auto-updating: For any auto-updating
information that (1) starts automatically
and (2) is presented in parallel with other
content, there is a mechanism for the user
to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the
frequency of the update unless the autoupdating is part of an activity where it is
essential.

2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold:
Web pages do not contain anything that
ashes more than three times in any one
second period, or the ash is below the
general ash and red ash thresholds.

Supports

macOS offers Dim Flashing Lights to enable users who are sensitive to
bright ashes of light to watch video content more comfortably; it
automatically darkens the display of video during sequences of ashing
lights so the user is not exposed to potentially risky content.

2.4.3 Focus Order: If a Web page can be
navigated sequentially and the navigation
sequences affect meaning or operation,
focusable components receive focus in an
order that preserves meaning and operability.

Supports

2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context): The
Supports
purpose of each link can be determined from
the link text alone or from the link text together
with its programmatically determined link
context, except where the purpose of the link
would be ambiguous to users in general.

Text descriptions are provided for navigation elements such as links,
tabs, and buttons throughout macOS. In addition, the Accessibility API
provides a method for third-party developers to provide additional help
information about these items.

2.5.1 Pointer Gestures: All functionality that
Supports
uses multipoint or path-based gestures for
operation can be operated with a single
pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a
multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation: For functionality
that can be operated using a single pointer, at
least one of the following is true:

Supports

• No Down-Event: The down-event of the
pointer is not used to execute any part of
the function;
• Abort or Undo: Completion of the function is
on the up-event, and a mechanism is
available to abort the function before
completion or to undo the function after
completion;
• Up Reversal: The up-event reverses any
outcome of the preceding down-event;
• Essential: Completing the function on the
down-event is essential.

2.5.3 Label in Name: For user interface
Supports
components with labels that include text or
images of text, the name contains the text that
is presented visually.

2.5.4 Motion Actuation: Functionality that
can be operated by device motion or user
motion can also be operated by user interface
components and responding to the motion
can be disabled to prevent accidental
actuation, except when:

Supports

• Supported Interface: The motion is used to
operate functionality through an accessibility
supported interface;
• Essential: The motion is essential for the
function and doing so would invalidate the
activity.
3.1.1 Language of Page: The default human
language of each Web page can be
programmatically determined.

Supports

3.2.1 On Focus: When any component
receives focus, it does not initiate a change of
context. (Level A)

Supports

VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader, does not initiate a change of
context without user interaction.

Page 11 of 47

3.2.2 On Input: Changing the setting of any
user interface component does not
automatically cause a change of context
unless the user has been advised of the
behavior before using the component.

Supports

3.3.1 Error Identi cation: If an input error is
Supports
automatically detected, the item that is in error
is identi ed and the error is described to the
user in text.

The Accessibility API allows third-party developers to provide extra
information about a setting before content changes are applied.

If an input error is automatically detected, macOS informs users through
dialogs, alert, error messages, and/or audio alerts. VoiceOver can speak
descriptions of alerts.
WebKit, the web browser engine used by Safari, also allows third-party
developers to notify users of errors occurring on web pages.

3.3.2 Labels or Instructions: Labels or
instructions are provided when content
requires user input.

Supports

The Accessibility API allows developers to specify input labels and bind
these labels to an input field.

4.1.1 Parsing: In content implemented using
markup languages, elements have complete
start and end tags, elements are nested
according to their speci cations, elements do
not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs
are unique, except where the speci cations
allow these features.

Supports

The Accessibility API allows the developers to specify the boundaries
and identification of controls.

302.1 Without Vision. Where a visual mode Supports
of operation is provided, ICT shall provide at
least one mode of operation that does not
require user vision.

Remarks and Explanations
For users without vision, macOS includes:
• VoiceOver: a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver for users who are blind or
have low vision, and includes accessible applications and utilities. VoiceOver is
available in over 60 languages and locales, and offers deep customization, such
as the option to adjust the type, rate, and pitch range of speech feedback. With
macOS, VoiceOver users can also sign PDFs by capturing their signature using
the trackpad or built-in camera, and make these graphical elements easier to
identify by adding custom descriptions for new and existing signatures. They can
also use markup to add image descriptions that can be read by VoiceOver. Image
descriptions persist even when shared and can be read in a range of supported
apps on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Applications built using the macOS Human
Interface Guidelines and the macOS Accessibility APIs will work with VoiceOver.
Information about VoiceOver is available at https://www.apple.com/accessibility/
vision/
• Siri supports natural-language voice commands to send messages, track down
files, create reminders, search the web, and more. Siri is integrated with
VoiceOver allowing users to have answers read out-loud. Users can customize
Siri to speak at a slower or faster rate, depending on needs and preferences
• Braille support: Built-in support for over 70 USB and wireless refreshable braille

mode of operation is provided, ICT shall
provide at least one mode of operation that
enables users to make use of limited vision.

Supports

macOS includes many features to assist users with low vision, including but not
limited to:
• VoiceOver, VoiceOver cursor zoom, Speak Selection, a scalable mouse cursor,
increased contrast with Dark Mode support, and Zoom—a built-in screen
magnification feature.
• Users can customize font size across Mac apps, including Finder, Messages,
Mail, Calendar, and Notes, in one place within System Settings, with the option to
set a single preferred reading size, or customize app by app.Applications, such as
Safari, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote also support increasing font sizes of
content up to or over 200%.
• With Zoom, users can magnify everything on screen making it larger and easier to
see. Text and graphics are enlarged for easier reading and QuickTime video plays
magnified without any performance degradation. The powerful Quartz rendering
and compositing engine makes Zoom view possible up to 20x. Zoom includes a
number of options including:
• Options to set maximum and minimum values for rapid zoom in and out
• Picture-in-picture zoom which allows users to see the zoomed area in a
separate window while keeping the rest of the screen at its native size
• Multi-monitor zoom when using zoom across multiple displays with macOS,
to set the right zoom level per display independently
• Hover Text which allows users to view high resolution text describing items
under the cursor in a text view
• Display Zoom which allows users to keep one monitor zoomed in while
another at the standard resolution
• Three options for how the screen moves as users navigate with the mouse
pointer: follow the cursor, only move when cursor reaches an edge, or center
the cursor on the screen
• Users who prefer to use the mouse can also use VoiceOver to hear a spoken
description of information that is under the mouse pointer in addition to using
Zoom. VoiceOver includes a scalable caption panel that displays spoken
descriptions of what s happening on screen as text. VoiceOver in macOS includes
built-in voices for over 60 languages.
• Custom Mouse Cursors allow users to change the outline and fill color to make
the cursor more easily recognizable
• Speak Selection provides text to speech functionality. You can also set the device
to highlight words, sentences, or words within each sentence while it is read
aloud.

Remarks and Explanations
macOS uses color to convey information. In many cases, when color is used, it
provides an alternative information display that does not rely on color. For example,
color controls are used in the title bar of macOS windows that allow a user to close,
minimize or maximize a window. While color indicates each control s function, each
control also has a unique symbol and position that indicates its function without
relying on color information. But, there are some visual elements that do not include
an alternative information display.
macOS also provides system-level control of display characteristics that cannot be
overridden by applications, including options to:
• Switch the display from color to grayscale
• Use a display color filter or color tint
• Invert light and dark colors displayed on the screen
• Differentiate certain elements without color
• Increase contrast of elements on the screen
• Reduce the transparency of elements on the screen
•Dim Flashing Lights to automatically darkens the display of video during
sequences of ashing lights
•Pause Animated Images to pause images with animations and movement, e.g.
GIFs, in apps such as Messages and Safari
All of these features are accessed through System Settings for Accessibility and
can be used together in different combinations to suit the user s needs.

later. High-quality video and fast frame rate make FaceTime ideal for those who
communicate using sign language. Many users can clearly see both hand and
finger gestures in detail giving them the technology to communicate from afar
with the same range of emotion used in person.
QuickTime – The QuickTime media player application supports playback and
display of video files that include open and closed captions, and auxiliary text
tracks. Users can select the appearance of closed captions and subtitles,
including fonts, highlights, and backgrounds.
