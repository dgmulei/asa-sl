Truancy Case Processing Practices
Executive Summary
In 1995, the legislature enacted the “Becca Bill,” which requires school districts to take legal
action against children or their parents when they fail to comply with state compulsory school
attendance laws.1 The law created new responsibilities for both schools and courts in fighting
truancy and is invaluable for making state compulsory education laws enforceable. However, the
new responsibilities have been challenging for both the schools and the courts. The legislation
has more than doubled the non-offender juvenile caseload and contributed to a substantial
growth in the backlog of unresolved cases. This study focuses on the processes that courts in
Washington use to handle truancy cases. The study is based on a statewide survey of juvenile
court administrators that was conducted in December 2003.
We found that many courts have implemented case processing innovations that reduce the
truancy case burden. Most courts have access to a variety of government, community, and
private resources to help resolve serious issues that contribute to a student’s attendance
problems. Most courts also use a series of escalating sanctions when students fail to comply with
their court order to attend school. We also found that courts typically have established close
relationships with schools in developing truancy programs and policies. Nearly all courts provide
training to school personnel on the truancy petition process, and many have other outreach
programs that involve regular meetings between school and court personnel or that involve staff
positions that serve as a liaison with school districts.
This study also identified a number of areas that raise concerns. Failures to appear are common
at truancy petition hearings and are contributing to backlogs of unresolved cases. Many courts
have no provisions for personal service and bench warrants to compel a courtroom appearance
for truancy. Court supervision of school attendance is another weak point in the process, because
most courts do not get attendance reports from schools, and schools have trouble keeping up with
contempt motions. Contempt standards and sanctions are remarkably different among the courts.
These inconsistencies and the reluctance of courts to use sanctions with real teeth have
contributed to schools’ reluctance to file truancy petitions with the courts.
Major findings include:
Case Processing Innovations:
• In eight courts (26 percent) prosecutors file truancy petitions, relieving some of the
burden on schools and providing an initial review for legal sufficiency for the courts.
• Seven courts (22 percent) use expedited case processing practices that do not require
individual hearings between students and a judge or commissioner for the initial truancy
petition hearing. Two courts (6 percent) do not involve judges or commissioners at all in
the initial truancy petition hearing.

The Becca Bill also covers child in need of services and at-risk youth petitions, but this study focuses on the
truancy aspects of the Becca Bill.

The Relationship between Courts and Schools:
• Fifteen courts (48 percent) report that they work together with schools in establishing
policies and programs, and 16 courts (52 percent) report that courts and schools
understand and cooperate with each other’s policies.
• Twenty-eight courts (88 percent) provide training to school personnel on the truancy
petition process.
Areas for Concern:
• Schools in three juvenile court district (9 percent) do not provide information on their
intervention efforts as a part of the truancy petition, even though this is required by the
statute.
• Schools in only six juvenile court district (19 percent) submit regular attendance reports
for students under court orders to attend school.
• Twenty-three courts (74 percent) rely on schools to file contempt motions, but schools
typically have difficulty keeping up with both truancy petitions and contempt motions.
• In twelve juvenile court districts (38 percent) the threshold for contempt on an order to
attend school is one additional unexcused absence, but in other juvenile court districts the
threshold is as low as one class period skipped or as high as several months of noncompliance.
• More than one-third of the courts impose no sanction after the first finding of contempt or
allow the sanction to be purge by simply attending school.
Top Three Recommendations for Helping Schools Meet Their Becca Bill Truancy Obligations:
• 47 % Increase the funding, resources, or incentives available to schools for the Becca
truancy process.
• 28% More school training, more consistent policies among school districts, or more
leadership from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction on truancy
matters.
• 25% Make filing truancy petitions mandatory by imposing sanctions on schools (or
school personnel) that don’t comply with the law.

Truancy Case Processing Practices
Introduction
In 1995, the legislature enacted the “Becca Bill,” which in part requires school districts to take
legal action against children or their parents when they fail to comply with state compulsory
school attendance laws. The law created new responsibilities for both schools and courts in
fighting truancy, and a number of studies have been conducted to assess the impact of law. This
study adds to our understanding of truancy reduction efforts by focusing on the court processes
used to handle truancy cases in courts across the state. This study will be of interest to judicial
officers and court administrators who continue to innovate in court processes, policy-makers
who want to evaluate the effectiveness of the truancy petition process, and school officials who
want to better understand court procedures and improve collaborative efforts with the courts in
addressing truancy.

The Truancy Petition Process: School and Court Responsibilities
The legislature passed the Becca Bill to give parents and communities better tools to help at-risk,
runaway, and truant youth. In the area of truancy, the law was designed to put teeth into
compulsory attendance laws by requiring schools to take certain steps to help students and
parents eliminate unexcused absences and then to take legal action if students or parents do not
respond to school efforts. The law makes truancy reduction a cooperative effort between schools
and courts. If schools do not do their part, the courts cannot intervene, and if the courts do not do
their part, the schools have no recourse to compel attendance.
School responsibilities begin with the first unexcused absence. After the first unexcused absence
in any month during the school year, the school must notify parents of the absence and inform
them of the potential consequences of truancy (see RCW 28A.225.020). After the second
unexcused absence within a month, the school must schedule a conference with the student and
the student’s parents and take steps to reduce absences, such as adjusting the student’s schedule,
providing vocational courses, referring them to a community truancy board, or requiring the
student to attend an alternative school. After the fifth unexcused absence within a month, the
school must file a truancy petition with the court, enter into an agreement with the student about
attendance requirements, or refer the student to a community truancy board (see RCW
28A.225.030). The school district must file a truancy petition with the court if a student has
accrued seven unexcused absence within a single month or ten unexcused absence in the entire
school year. The petition alleges that the student has violated state compulsory attendance laws,
that school efforts at reducing the student’s absences have not been effective, and that court
intervention is necessary to reduce absences(see RCW 28A.225.035). The petition must also
identify the child, document the absences, list school efforts to reduce absences, and provide
recommendations as to what the actions the court should take. If the court assumes jurisdiction
and enters an order, the school must regularly report additional unexcused absences.
Court responsibilities begin once the school has filed the truancy petition. The court must
schedule a hearing to consider the petition or refer the student to a community truancy board. If

3

the allegations in the petition are established by a preponderance of evidence or by agreement
with the student, the court enters an order and supervises the student’s school attendance. The
order may require students to attend their current school, attend another public or nonsectarian
school, participate in a public educational program, work with a community truancy board, or
submit to drug or alcohol testing (see RCW 28A.225.090). A student who does not comply with
the order may be subject to a civil contempt proceeding and be subject to up to seven days of
detention or detention alternatives. Any parent violating the order may be fined $25 per day for
each unexcused absence or required to provide community restitution.

Impacts and Trends
Most studies of the truancy petition process have reported positive impacts. An early study
reports a great increase in the number of petitions filed over the first two years of implementation
and a general strengthening of attendance monitoring and enforcement policies among schools.2
Later studies found that students were more likely to stay in school and that high school
enrollment rates increase after the Becca law was passed.3 A survey of school principals
demonstrated that three out of four survey respondents felt that the truancy petition process has
reduced unexcused absences.4 However, questions still remain as to the effectiveness of the
program. The findings with regard to increasing high school enrollment were based on aggregate
data, and a study using individual level data found that filing a truancy petition has no impact on
the likelihood that a student will remain in school.5 There has been no research conducted to
assess whether school interventions have been effective.
The court community is committed to the truancy petition process as a way of improving school
attendance but also sees additional benefits. The Becca Bill truancy process provides a way to
reach out to youth who are at risk for developing more serious legal issues. Mason County
Commissioner Richard C. Adamson explains that the Becca Bill truancy process “peeled back
the layers society, exposing a whole strata of dysfunctional families that we had not seen
before.” Bringing these youth back to school and providing additional services where necessary
can help break the cycle of disfunctionality and connect these young people to a brighter future.
Achieving these positive results has placed heavy burdens on both the courts and the schools.
The Becca truancy process has resulted in a tremendous increase in the non-offender juvenile
caseload (see Figure 1). As a result of the legislation, the number of truancy filings grew from 91
in 1994 to 10,232 in 1996, surpassing the total number of all other types of non-offender juvenile
cases. Truancy filings reached their peak in 1998 with 16,607 new cases compared to 7,587 new

The Becca Bill presented schools with a somewhat different challenge. While the courts faced
growing caseloads, the schools had to develop entirely new processes for performing early
interventions and filing petitions. Schools have had difficulty adapting to these new
responsibilities, and state funding for these functions falls far short of the actual costs. The state
provides no funding for early interventions or contempt filings and only about $90 per truancy
petition, compare to the $360 estimated the cost of preparing and submitting each truancy
petition.6 The financial burdens of early interventions and petition filing have grown as a result
of funding cuts for schools.
These institutional and financial burdens have resulted in low and declining school support for
the truancy petition process. During the 1996-97 school year 30 percent of the state’s school
districts filed no truancy petitions, and by the 2000-01 school year 40 percent of the state’s
school districts filed no petitions.7 Similarly, the number of truancy petitions filed has declined
as a percentage of the students who have ten or more unexcused absences.8 School participation

This discussion uses the ten or more absence threshold as the benchmark for school participation in the Becca
truacy process, because schools report the number of students who reach this threshold, and filing at this point is
mandatory. Schools must also file a truancy petition when a student has seven unexcused absences in a month, but
they do not report the number of students who reach this threshold. Schools report the number of students with five

were filed on 46 percent of students with ten or more unexcused absences (see Figure 2). By the
2002-2003 school year filings were down to 31 percent of the number of students with ten or
more unexcused absences. Even at the height of support for the program, the Becca Bill truancy
process reached less than half of the targeted students, and now it reaches less than one-third of
those students.

Notes: One school district had not reported absences for the 2002-2003 school year to the
Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction at the time this report was prepared. This
has no impact on the percentages reported here, since it is a small school district and there
were only five students from this district with ten or more absences in the 2001-2002 school
year.

The Truancy Case Processing Survey
This study examines court procedures for truancy cases, as well as the relationship between
courts and schools in addressing truancy issues. The study is based on a survey of juvenile court
administrators throughout the state (See the appendix for a copy of the questionnaire.). The
survey design process involved site visits to five juvenile courts during October and November
of 2003 to observe truancy proceedings and interview court personnel. We mailed the Truancy
absences in a month, but filing at this point is optional. Schools have the option to enter into an agreement with the
student establishing attendance requirements or to refer the student to a truancy board rather than filing a truancy
petition with the court.

December 12, 2003, and followed-up by phone with non-responding courts in January 2004. We
obtained responses from 32 courts for a response rate of 97 percent. The percentages given in the
tables throughout this report are for the 32 responding courts, not all 33 courts. On a few tables
the number of respondents is 31 rather than 32, because some courts did not answer all the

I. Truancy Petitions
Filing
Court involvement in school attendance is initiated by the filing of a truancy petition. The
petition alleges that a student has violated compulsory attendance laws and requests the court to
take jurisdiction over the matter. Schools define what constitutes an unexcused absence and track
attendance. School districts are required to file a truancy petition when a student has seven
unexcused absences in a month or ten unexcused absences during the school year. Schools
districts in 26 percent of the responding juvenile court districts have arranged to submit an
attendance report to the prosecutor’s office and have the prosecutor file the legal documents with
the court (see Table 1). This arrangement reduces the school workload involved in filing
petitions and serves as a filter for the court by reviewing the legal sufficiency of the case. The
prosecutor’s office also usually presents the cases in court, which can reduce the amount of time
school officials must spend in court. Some of these school districts pass all or part of the state
reimbursement for truancy petition filing on to the prosecutor’s office.

Petition Hearings
Juvenile courts have developed a variety of procedures for handling the workload of truancy
petition proceedings. Some of these differing strategies can be seen by identifying the
participants in truancy petition hearings. Judicial officers (either judges or court commissioners)
are involved in truancy petition hearings in 30 courts (94 percent), whereas two courts (6
percent) use procedures that do not involve judicial officers (see Table 2). The initial hearing
typically gives students the option of signing an agreed order compelling school attendance or
contesting the petition. For an agreed order, the student rather than a judicial officer makes the
determination on whether compulsory attendance laws were broken. Accordingly, some courts
have structured their process to minimize or eliminate the involvement of judicial officers until a
student contests the petition or fails to comply with the order. Others believe that the judicial
officer plays an important symbolic role in the hearing by emphasizing the seriousness with
which the court regards truancy matters.
After judicial officers, school officials are the second most common participant in truancy
petition hearings. They are involved in the truancy petition hearings in 22 courts (69 percent). In
courts where each student receives an individual hearing with a judge or commissioner, school
officials typically are present to provide testimony on attendance records and school

8

interventions. Some courts use the hearing as an opportunity to have truant students meet with
either school or school district officials to begin the process of assessing their education program
and overcoming obstacles to academic progress.
Probation officers are involved in truancy hearings in 60 percent of the responding courts even
though truancy is not a criminal offense and does not involve probation. In some courts
probation officers help organize the hearing and facilitate case flow. Other courts use probation
officers to help identify students with special needs and help connect them to court and
community resources. Some courts use probation officers to conduct the hearing as a group
session with or without the involvement of a judge or commissioner. Five courts have case
managers separate from probation staff to perform these functions. These case managers are
typically funded through grants, but one county has drawn upon a volunteer community
organization for case work.

* The number of courts does not sum to 32 and the percent of courts does not sum to 100%
because the question allowed responses to more than one category.
Prosecutors are involved in truancy petition hearings in 11 courts (34 percent), and public
defenders are involved in 9 courts (28 percent). Prosecutors present truancy petitions in courts
where the school districts have arranged for the prosecutor’s office to file truancy petitions. In
three additional courts, prosecutors appear in court after school officials prepare and file
petitions. Public defenders are used for contempt hearings because students’ liberty is at stake,
but they also may be present during truancy petition hearings in courts where all truancy matters
are scheduled on the same docket.
Twenty-five courts (78 percent) use the typical judicial process of giving each case an individual
hearing (see Table 3). Other courts have adopted procedures that reduce the amount of time that
truancy petition hearings take or limit the role of judicial officers. Three courts (9 percent) have
students meet individually with school officials, probation officers, or prosecutors who explain
the process and the penalties for further absences and, in some cases, develop education plans to
avoid future absences rather than appearing before a judge or commissioner. Four courts (13
percent) process truancy petitions entirely in batch mode with no individualized attention unless

9

students want to contest the petition. In these courts respondents to the truancy petitions typically
meet as a group with a probation officer who explains the petition process and potential
consequences and fields questions from the group.

Contesting the Petition
Though most students sign an agreed order, some choose to contest the petition. In 53 percent of
the courts, students who wish to contest the petition can do so on the same day as the initial
hearing on the petition (see Table 4). If the court is using individual hearings for each
respondent, an additional proceeding is not usually required, but if the court is using a group
format for the hearing, an individual hearing is held after the group hearing has been completed.
These courts feel that this procedure reduces the time students are out of school for courtroom
appearances and that reducing the time between the offense and the sanction is particularly
important for helping teenagers modify their behavior. Forty-seven percent of the courts
schedule the contested hearings for another day, typically in one to two weeks.

Failure-to-Appear
Students who skip school may also have a tendency to miss their court dates. The failure-toappear (FTA) rate on truancy petitions is as high as 30 percent in some courts. No shows at

10

truancy petition hearings seem to be the primary cause of the 29 percent increase in pending
juvenile dependency cases over the period of 1998 to 2002.
Courts typically issue bench warrants when FTAs occur. For truancy matters, RCW 28A.225.030
requires personal service of the notice and summons if certified mail service is unsuccessful.
Actual court practice appears to diverge somewhat from the statutory requirement. We asked
juvenile court administrators to identify the sequence of events they follow after a student fails to
appear for their truancy petition hearing. Their responses indicate that 55 percent of the
responding courts require personal service before issuing a bench warrant or entering a default
order, whereas 32 percent do not. An additional 13 percent indicated that they do not use bench
warrants or default orders on truancy petitions (see Table 5).

Personal service is usually the responsibility of the petitioner, but personal service is expensive,
and many schools are already financially strained by filing petitions. When asked, “Who
arranges and pays for personal service of the summons when students fail to respond to a mail
notice and summons for a truancy petition?” only 3 courts (9 percent) replied that the school or
school district arranges and pays for personal service (see Table 6). Three courts (9 percent)
report that the prosecutor’s office handles personal service, but the responsibility for personal
service has largely fallen to the courts if it is done at all. Forty-seven percent of courts handle
personal service. The sheriff performs personal service for one court. Nearly one-third of the
courts indicated that personal service is not typically used for truancy petitions.

Special Programs
Many juvenile courts have developed special programs to better manage their truancy caseload
and improve outcomes for students. These programs typically involve cooperative efforts
between the court, schools, and community organizations to serve troubled youth. These special
programs include court-at-school, truancy classes, and deferred petition programs.
Court-at-school:
One of the simplest programs involves holding court sessions at school for truancy petitions.
This reduces the time students must spend away from school for court room appearances, and
helps some students return to school. Holding regular court sessions at school can also facilitate
communications between court and school officials and can make holding regular review
hearings less onerous. Mason County and Island County have both established court-at-school
programs for truancy.
Truancy Classes:
Ten courts provide or require students to attend truancy classes or attendance workshops. The
formats for these programs vary substantially, but they all include information about attendance
laws, the truancy petition process, and the consequences of being found in contempt of the court.
Some of these programs also include content that emphasizes the importance of education in
becoming independent and self-sufficient. Some of these programs also help students develop
personal education plans. In Jefferson County students attend a truancy class as part of the prepetition school interventions. The King, Lincoln, and Skagit county juvenile courts use truancy
classes as part of a deferred petition program. The Snohomish and Thurston county juvenile
courts hold a truancy class at the beginning of the truancy petition hearing. The Pierce, Spokane,
Benton/Franklin, and Clark county juvenile courts requires students to participate in a truancy
class offered by a school or community organization as a part of the truancy order.
Deferred Truancy Petition Programs:
Twelve courts have deferred petition programs that keep students out of court if they participate
in a truancy intervention program. These programs can substantially reduce the number of

12

truancy petition hearings and provide better support to the majority of students who are willing
to change their behavior. In King County, students who previously have not had a truancy
petition or other matter before the court are given the option to participate in an attendance
workshop rather than appear in court. Attendance workshops last for two and a half hours and
involve presentations on truancy law by a deputy prosecuting attorney. Parents and students
participate in separate small group sessions conducted by trained facilitators. Students enter into
a contract that specifies steps they will take to improve their attendance. The contracts are placed
in their court file, and school districts report on their progress after 30 days. The court then
schedules a preliminary hearing for students whose attendance does not improve. Most students
successfully complete their contract, and the program has reduced the number of preliminary
truancy hearings by as much as 57 percent.
The Benton/Franklin Juvenile Court uses truancy boards to provide individualized
assistance to students with attendance problems and reduce the court resources involved in
preliminary truancy petition hearings. When a school files a truancy petition, the court refers the
student to a truancy board. No court room appearance is necessary unless the student does not
attend the truancy board hearing. The board makes every effort to help students make their
hearing appointment. Truancy board hearings are usually held at the mall, because it is a hub for
the county transit system, and occasionally the board even holds hearings at students’ homes.
During the hearing, the student signs a court order compelling school attendance, and the board
assesses the student’s personal and family issues that are interfering with school attendance. The
board then develops an intervention plan, which may include referrals to agencies or community
resources. A case manager follows-up with service referrals and maintains weekly contact with
the school. The case manager works with the student for the duration of the order, which is
usually for the current school year.

13

II. Truancy Orders and Court Supervision
If the student signs an agreed order or the court determines that the student has reached the
threshold for unexcused absences in a contested hearing, the court enters a truancy order
compelling school attendance. However, 30 counties (94 percent) will not enter a truancy order if
the school has not met any of its responsibilities for early interventions. Although the statute
requires schools to meet all their intervention obligations before filing, two courts accept
petitions even if none of the school interventions have been made. Determining if schools have
fulfilled their obligations requires information on schools’ intervention efforts, but a few schools
do not provide this information in the attendance reports they submit to the courts (see Table 20).

Attendance Reports
Even after the juvenile court assumes jurisdiction for supervising attendance, the court still must
rely on the schools for attendance information. RCW 28A.225.035 requires that “the school
district shall regularly report to the court any additional unexcused absences by the child.”
However, regular reporting is not at all common. Only 6 (19 percent) of the courts receive
attendance reports on a regular periodic basis (see Table 8). Attendance reports are primarily
obtained through requests by the court or are submitted along with contempt motions. Regular
reporting may be uncommon because schools are only required to make a report if there are
additional unexcused absences after a court order is entered, and many schools file contempt
motions after one additional absence. Unfortunately, courts cannot tell if the schools are keeping
up with contempt motions, unless the schools also provide regular attendance reports.

Method of Supervising Attendance
Courts may use proactive or reactive approaches to supervise attendance. A proactive approach
typically involves holding review hearings to determine if the court order is being followed,
whereas reactive approaches typically wait for schools to file a contempt motion before taking
further action. One-quarter of the courts use the proactive approach, which gives the court a
more direct means of supervising attendance (see Table 6). However, review hearings require a

14

lot of court time given the volume of the truancy caseload, and they also take students out of the
classroom. The reactive approach is more popular, with three-quarters of the courts waiting for
the schools to file contempt motions. This option is more efficient in terms of court time, but
schools are not reimbursed for filing contempt motions so they may delay or fail altogether to do
so.
Interviews with court personnel indicate that schools often get behind on their contempt motions.
A prosecutor reported that in some cases schools have waited until students have accrued more
than forty additional unexcused absences before filing a contempt motion. During court visits in
conjunction with this study, the author observed several examples of the problem. In one case
where a gifted but unmotivated high school student had dropped out of an alternative education
program that he had been order to attend, the parent complained, “I’m frustrated because they
[the school] didn’t send this to court last year when they dropped him from the program.” In
another case, a student had failed to comply with a court order from the previous school year to
return to school. The mother was a single parent, who had to leave early each morning to take a
bus to work and did not know her daughter was not attending school. These delays in filing
contempt motions allow students to fall even further behind in their academic progress,
increasing the likelihood that they will not graduate.

Length of Attendance Supervision
When the Becca Bill was passed in 1995, it authorized courts to take jurisdiction over school
attendance only for the current school year in which a student violates mandatory attendance
laws. In 1997 the legislature amended the law to give courts discretion in setting the period of
supervision. Many courts choose not to exercise this additional discretion. Thirteen court (fortyone percent) still take jurisdiction over attendance only for the current school year (see Table 9).
Four courts (13 percent) extended jurisdiction into the next school year when truancy petitions
are filed near the end of the school year, and two courts (6 percent) always supervise attendance
into the next school year to make sure students with attendance problems are registered and
attending school after the summer break. Six courts (19 percent) supervise attendance for a
period of one calendar year, which usually will take them into the next school year. Four courts
have opted to maintain supervision until a student turns 18 or receives a GED.

Before the 1997 amendment, the only way to maintain court supervision over students whose
petition was filed at the end of the school year was to get a court order extending jurisdiction into
the next school year. Although it is no longer necessary, 13 courts still require a separate order to
extend jurisdiction into the next school year. The additional court proceeding to extend the order
could be avoided by specifying the period of supervision in the initial order or by taking
jurisdiction until the student is not subject to compulsory attendance laws.

Case Management
Some students under court supervision need additional resources to help them overcome issues
that are interfering with school attendance or follow-up to make sure they comply with the court
order. The courts use a variety of resources to help troubled students connect with community
resources and follow-up on their attendance. About half of courts rely on probation officers to
help with truancy cases (see Table 10). Using grants, two courts have hired case managers to
16

focus exclusively on truancy cases, and two additional courts use volunteers. Six courts have
made other arrangements, typically using outside resources such as the county health department,
school attendance counselors, or school truant officers. Nine courts have no provisions for case
management for truancy.

17

III. Noncompliance/Contempt
Many students return to school or improve their attendance as a result of a court truancy order,
but others do not. If a student continues to be truant after a court order to attend school is
entered, the student may be found to be in contempt of the court.

Filing Contempt Motions
Truancy takes place outside the presence of the court, so court enforcement of the order is
usually initiated by a motion from the filer of the truancy petition. Fifty-six percent of the courts
rely on the school or school district to file a contempt motion if a student continues to be truant
(see Table 11). The prosecutor’s office files contempt motions in thirty-four percent of the
courts. These are typically the same courts where schools have arranged for the prosecutor’s
office to file truancy petitions, but the prosecutor’s office files contempt motions in three
additional courts. Two courts (6 percent) file contempt motions themselves. Both of these courts
use probation officers for case management and request attendance information from schools.
This practice may allow better enforcement of court truancy orders, since school RCW28A.225
only requires schools to file petitions, not contempt motions, and schools are not reimbursed for
filing contempt motions. In one juvenile court district, the school notifies the juvenile department
of additional unexcused absences and the juvenile department files the contempt motion.

Contempt Proceeding Participants
Once a contempt motion is filed, the court schedules a show cause hearing. There are some
important differences between truancy petition hearings and contempt hearings. Although the
role of judicial officers in truancy petition hearings differs among many of the courts, a judge or
commissioner always conducts the show cause hearing on contempt motions in all the courts,
and each student receives an individual hearing (see Table 12). Public defenders are present to
represent students in all but two courts. School or school district officials are more likely to be
present to give testimony on contempt motions, and more courts use prosecutors to present
contempt motions than truancy petitions. Probation officers also are more likely to be involved.

Supervising School Attendance for Students Found in Contempt
The courts typically take a more proactive role in supervising the attendance of students found to
be in contempt of the truancy order. Whereas only about one-quarter of the courts set hearings to
review attendance after an order is issued in response to a truancy petition, 65 percent of the
courts set review hearings for students who have been found to be in contempt on their court
order (see Table 13).

Standards for Contempt
Standards for filing a contempt motion are so remarkably varied among juvenile court districts
that in one county a contempt motion could be filed if a student skips a single class period while
in another county a contempt motion would only be filed after a student continues to be truant
for several months. Some schools take into consideration factors, such as tardies and discipline
problems, but all of the courts report that additional absences are a cause for filing a contempt
motion (see Table 14). However there is little uniformity on the threshold of absences at which
19

schools file contempt motions. One court reports that the threshold is one class missed. This
standard is rather surprising since an unexcused absence is typically defined as failure “to attend
the majority of hours or period in an average school day” (RCW 28A.225.020), though schools
do have the option of setting more restrictive policies. Twelve courts (38 percent) report that
schools use a threshold of a single additional unexcused absence, and another three courts (9
percent) report that the threshold is two additional unexcused absences. Another court reports
that schools file contempt motions after the third unexcused absence. Several courts report that
schools use more flexible standards, such as one to three additional unexcused absences or five
to ten additional unexcused absences. One court reports that contempt motions are filed only as a
last resort after months of noncompliance and other interventions aren’t working.

Sanctions
RCW 28A.225.090 authorizes courts to place students who fail to comply with a court order in
detention for up to seven days or to use detention alternatives. Because noncompliance with a
court order on a truancy matter is a civil contempt of the court, the court must offer purge
conditions, which enable the student to avoid the continued imposition of the sanction. Purge
conditions must be reasonably related to the contempt and within the youth’s power to fulfill.
However, the issue of contempt has been volleyed back and forth between the legislature and
appellate courts, causing some uncertainty at the trial level regarding the appropriateness of
detention as a sanction for truancy contempt. Survey responses from some courts suggest that
court practices with regard to sanctions and purge conditions may depart from what is
specifically authorized by statute. For example, one court reports that the court orders 30 days
detention for each finding of contempt. At least one court requires completion of detention time
on the third finding of contempt without a purge condition.
Most courts have several types of sanctions at their disposal for enforcing truancy orders.
Detention is the most common sanction (see Table 15). The courts that don’t use detention rely
on sanctions such as community service, day detention, and weekend detention. Community
service is the second most common sanction. Other sanctions, such as day detention, weekend
detention, and electronic home monitoring are less common, but give the courts more flexibility

20

to impose incrementally more severe sanctions. They also may provide options when detention
facilities are full.

We asked court administrators to report the purge conditions that their court typically uses for
the first finding of contempt. Their responses show that many courts are slow to impose
sanctions in truancy cases. Even after students have failed to respond to numerous school
interventions and a court order to attend school, four courts (13 percent) do not use a sanction for
the first finding of contempt (see Table 16). Ten additional courts (31 percent) merely require
that students attend school to purge the first finding of contempt. Some schools have been
reluctant to file truancy petitions, because they do not feel that the truancy process has any real
teeth. Four juvenile court administrators suggested that swifter sanctions would help encourage
schools to fulfill their obligations to file truancy petitions (see Table 24).
However, most courts impose sanctions and purge conditions that require some effort. Seven
courts (22 percent) require the completion of an essay, make-up work, or other assignments as
the purge condition. Some of these courts allow the work to be completed prior to reporting to
detention, whereas others require the work to be completed in detention. Ten courts (31 percent)
use purge conditions that may involve community service. At least one court suspends detention
to give the student an opportunity to complete the required hours of community service. It is not
clear whether other courts suspend detention to allow community service to be completed or
whether they order community service as a detention alternative without providing purge
conditions. The court that orders 30 days of detention for each finding of contempt did not
specify any purge conditions.

IV. Services
Some students have serious issues that are interfering with their school attendance. Courts often
try to help students address underlying problems that contribute to truancy. Many courts have
developed cooperative arrangements with outside resources, such as other government agencies,
nonprofit organizations, and even private service providers, to help students get the help they
need. RCW 28A.225.090 authorizes courts to order a truant student to submit to testing for drug
and alcohol use. Twenty-nine of the 32 responding courts are exercising this authority (see Table
17). The courts typically refer students to nonprofit organizations or private providers for drug
and alcohol evaluations. Parents are usually responsible for the costs, but many nonprofit
organizations do not charge for their services, and some courts are willing to pay for drug testing
if finances are an issue. Most courts also refer students who may have psychological issues for
mental evaluations and to counseling. Other services that many courts utilize include anger
management classes, counseling for parents, parenting classes, tutoring, and case management.
Only two courts address economic issues such as food and housing. Issues such as homelessness
can be a serious impediment to school attendance, and courts can refer students facing economic
hardships to the many government and community programs that are available to provide
assistance.

Notes: Figures represent the number of courts. Many courts use more than one provider and payer for ordered
services.

The courts may have difficulty identifying issues that are interfering with a student’s school
attendance, but early identification of serious issues can help students begin to make progress
and avoid further court appearances. Most courts try to identify issues at the truancy petition
hearing rather than waiting until a contempt motion is filed against a student (see Table 17).
Identifying these issues is especially difficult given the short amount of time that a student
spends in the courtroom with a judge. Nearly one-third of the courts report that judges initiate

23

requests for services, but most courts rely heavily on others who know the students better to
make recommendations for services. School officials the most common initiator of a request for
services. Schools typically make recommendations for services as a part of their truancy petition
or contempt motion. RCW 28A.225.035 specifies that the truancy petition should “provide
information about what the court might order,” and most schools follow this procedure (see
Table 20). Probation officers or case managers are the second most common initiator of service
requests and are typically more involved once the student is found in contempt of the initial court
order. Some courts also report that parents and student’s legal counsel also initiate requests for
services.

V. Schools
Schools have the responsibility for early truancy interventions and initiating court action against
students who don’t comply with mandatory attendance laws. Because schools are so important to
the Becca Bill truancy process, we asked courts several questions about school practices and the
relationship between the schools and courts on truancy matters.

Early School Interventions
Schools have the primary responsibility for preventing truancy, and the courts only become
involved when students fail to respond to school efforts to encourage attendance. According to
RCW 28A.225.020 after the first unexcused absence, schools contact the student’s parents to
inform them of the absence and the potential consequences. After two unexcused absence within
a single month, the school schedules a conference with the student and the student’s parents and
takes steps to eliminate or reduce absences. The school may adjust the student’s schedule, place
the student in a vocational education program, require attendance in an alternative education
program, or refer the student to a community truancy board. After the fifth absence in a month,
the school is required to enter into an agreement with the student establishing attendance
requirements, refer the student to a community truancy board, or file a petition with the court
alleging a violation of the mandatory attendance requirements. Upon the seventh unexcused
absence in a month or the tenth unexcused absence in a school year, the school district is
required to file a petition with the court. We asked courts whether schools were fulfilling these
responsibilities for early interventions. Nearly all (91 percent) of the courts replied that schools
are making the required efforts (see Table 19). This is important, because the petition is not valid
unless schools have made these efforts. However, a number of courts also qualified their answer
by indicating that while the schools make attempts to contact parents and to schedule
conferences, those efforts are often unsuccessful. Several courts did not know whether schools
were making the required interventions, because schools in their juvenile court district do not
provide the information on truancy petitions.

Information Provided by the Schools in Truancy Petitions
RCW 28A.225.035 specifies that truancy petitions submitted to the court must include the
number of unexcused absences the student has accrued, a report on the actions the school has
taken to reduce absences, and recommendations on what the court might order. All of the courts
indicate that truancy petitions report the number of unexcused absences in their truancy petitions,
but schools in some juvenile court districts omit some of the other required information while
schools in other court districts provide additional information that may be helpful to the court.
Eighty-eight percent of the courts report that truancy petitions contain the number of excused
absences that students have (see Table 20). Some schools may be concerned that parents write
excuses for students who have missed a lot of days to avoid having the child sent to court.
Ninety-one percent of the courts indicated that truancy petitions provide information about the
steps the schools have taken to reduce absences. Truancy petitions filed in three courts do not
provide this information, even though it is mandated in the statute. Truancy petitions in most
courts also provide information on discipline issues, grades, and academic progress. For
example, the Shelton school district’s attendance secretary emails teachers a request for
comments on students with truancy petition hearings or review hearings and includes teachers’
responses in the reports submitted to the court. Truancy petitions in 72 percent of the courts
provide recommendations for court actions or services that the student might need. Truancy
petitions in nine courts do not contain this information, even though it is mandated by the statute.

Court Training and Outreach Efforts with Schools
Some courts provide training to help schools understand their Becca truancy responsibilities and
to make sure that school personnel understand the process of filing petitions with the court.
Thirty-four percent of the courts have no specific schedule for providing training (see Table 21).
These courts may provide training on request from a school or if there seems to be a specific
training need. Thirty-eight percent of the courts provide training when there is turnover in a
school position involved in the truancy petition process. Thirty-four percent of the courts provide

26

training annually, and another 16 percent of the courts conduct training two or more times during
the school year. Four courts provide no training to school personnel.

The most common formats for training meetings are seminars with personnel from all of the
school districts in the juvenile court district, followed by site visits, in which the court or
prosecutor’s office sends a representative to each school district to provide individual training.
Five courts hold a court day that allows school officials to observe truancy proceedings and
receive instruction on the filing process.

In addition to training efforts, many courts have other outreach programs to improve cooperation
between schools and the court on truancy matters. Some courts rely on informal methods such as
frequent phone contact while others participate in regularly scheduled meetings with school
personnel. Regular meetings may include other juvenile issues in addition to truancy. For
27

example, one court conducts bi-monthly meetings with school officials for pre-filing reviews and
post-filing monitoring of at-risk youth, child-in-need-services, and truancy cases. Some courts
participate in separate meetings focusing on truancy. One court participates in regular meetings
for a truancy team composed of school district attendance officers, community truancy board
representatives, and court personnel. A few courts have established staff positions jointly with
schools districts or used grant funding to hire a staff member who facilitates communications
between the court and the schools. Other courts have newsletters or produce public education
materials to help schools and the community stay informed of court policies and processes
relating to truancy.

Cooperation Between Schools and the Courts
Addressing truancy is a cooperative effort with both schools and courts shouldering a part the
responsibilities. Truancy reduction can be most effective when there is close communication and
cooperation between the courts and the schools. We asked courts to evaluate their relationship
with schools in addressing truancy, and the responses were remarkably positive. Forty-eight
percent of the courts responded that the court and the schools work together in establishing
policies and programs, and 52 percent reported that the court and the schools understand and
cooperate with one another’s policies. None of the courts felt that they were not very familiar
with one another’s policies, or that they had conflicting polices, or a severe lack of cooperation
with schools.

Ways to Help Schools Meet Their Becca Bill Truancy Obligations
We asked court administrators for suggestions about how the truancy petition process could be
changed to help schools meet their obligations to file petitions, because the low rate of school
filings appears to be a serious limitation on the ability of the courts to address truancy. We
grouped similar responses into several categories. The most common recommendation (47
percent of the courts) is to increase the funding, resources, or incentives for schools to file
petitions. Twenty-eight percent of the courts thought that schools need more training on the
requirements of the law, that more consistent policies between school districts were necessary, or
that more leadership from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction is necessary to

28

encourage more school districts be more vigilant in filing truancy petitions. One-quarter of the
courts felt that the law needed to be changed to make filing mandatory for schools by imposing
sanctions for noncompliance, much like the federal “No Student Left Behind” law imposes
penalties for noncompliance. Five courts said that they needed options for stronger sanctions for
students who don’t respond to seven days of detention or parents who don’t respond to $25 fines.
Four courts indicated that schools would have more confidence in the process if the courts
processed petitions more quickly and didn’t wait so long before imposing sanctions on students
who continue to be truant. Three courts recommended that burdens on the schools from the
paperwork involved in filing petitions and making courtroom appearances to provide testimony
on attendance should be reduced. One court mentioned that schools should be prohibited from
expelling students or dropping students from their rolls for truancy, and one court suggested that
every school district should have attendance counselors to help to work with students.
