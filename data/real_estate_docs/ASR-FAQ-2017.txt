Section B: General Questions
Q B-1: If I properly complete, certify, and submit my system’s ASR Forms Package to DOH using
the website, do I also need to submit signed hard copies of the completed forms to DOH?
A:

No. ASR systems must use the website to complete, certify, and submit all their required ASR
forms for the reporting year. You don’t need to mail hard copies to DOH.

Q B-2: If I properly complete, certify, and submit all my system’s required ASR forms to DOH via
the website, will my PWS comply with the annual CCC reporting requirements of WAC
246-290-490(8)(d)?
A:

Yes.

Q B-3: This reporting year, we had a written CCC Program Plan, but no implementation activities.
We plan to start implementing our CCC Program soon. What ASR forms should we
complete for this reporting year and what should we report?
A:

At a minimum, all ASR systems must submit blue and cream forms and report CCC Program
information for the previous calendar year. You should:
•

Complete the cream form based on your written CCC Program Plan, policies, and
procedures.

•

On the blue form, page 1 Part 2, select the “No” radio button on CCC implementation
activities. Fill out the rest of the blue form as much as possible. Enter a comment on your
blue form explaining your plans and schedule to implement your CCC Program.

•

Report information on your system’s implementation activities on next year’s ASR forms.

Q B-4: We had no written CCC Program Plan and no CCC implementation activities this
reporting year. Do we still have to submit ASR forms for this reporting year?
A:

Yes, at a minimum, all ASR systems must submit blue and cream forms. You should:
•

Fill out the blue form as much as possible. On the blue form, page 1 Part 2, select the “No”
radio button on written CCC Program Plan and the “No” radio button on CCC
implementation activities.

•

Fill out the cream form as much as possible and reflect any CCC policies or procedures
you’ve developed or currently follow.

•

Contact DOH as soon as possible for help in developing and implementing your CCC
Program.

Q B-5: Do I have to complete an Exception to Premises Isolation Form, if I didn’t grant any new
exceptions in the current reporting year?
A:

Generally, no, you don’t need to complete any new Exception forms for this reporting year.
However, if you granted an exception in a past reporting year, but didn’t submit a completed
Exception form to DOH that reporting year, you must complete an Exception form for the
previously granted exception. See Q J-3 for more information on this subject.

Q B-6: Do I need to complete every field on the PWS Contact Screen and each ASR form?
A:

Generally, yes, you must complete most data fields on the PWS Contact Information Screen to
successfully Submit your information and access new ASR forms. When you click Submit, the
website will mark certain fields as “required” in red if you’ve left them blank.

ASR FAQs

Page 2

January 31, 2018

Similarly, you must complete most data fields on the ASR forms to successfully Submit your ASR
Forms Package to DOH. When you click Ready to Submit or Ready to Submit All ASR Forms,
the website will mark certain fields on the ASR forms as “required” if you’ve left them blank.
This rule doesn’t apply to fields the website completes for you. These fields appear grayed out,
and the website disables them to block entry of data by users.
To summarize, the website flags missing required fields on the:
o

PWS Contact Screen when you click Submit.

o

ASR forms when you click Ready to Submit.

o

ASR forms when you click Ready to Submit All ASR Forms from the
New/Edit/Print Forms Screen.

Q B-7: Is it OK to estimate number field values on my ASR forms?
A:

We discourage ASR systems from estimating values for number fields. You should always fill out
your ASR forms as accurately as possible, because DOH uses ASR data as the basis for CCC
compliance.
If you enter estimated values on any of your ASR forms, note this in the Comments Section for the
specific form, explain why you don’t have accurate data for this reporting year, and tell us what
steps you’re taking so you can report accurate data the next reporting year.

Q B-8: When I’m working on one of my ASR forms, when do I click the Save button and when do I
click Ready to Submit?
A:

Use the Save button to save your ASR form as a draft (work in progress). We recommend you
Save:
•

Before your session times out.

•

When you must leave your computer during a data entry session.

•

When your data entry session is interrupted by a phone call, visitor, need to go into the
field, etc.

Note: any time you change pages within an ASR form, the website auto-saves the data entered on
the page you’re leaving.
Click the Ready to Submit button when you’re finished entering data for your entire ASR form.
This will save your entire form and prompt the website to check for data errors within the form.
You can Save or click Ready to Submit from any page within an ASR form.
Q B-9: When do I click the Ready to Submit All ASR Forms button on the New/Edit/Print Screen?
A:

When you’re done filling out all your ASR forms, click the Ready to Submit All ASR Forms
button on the New/Edit/Print Forms Screen. This action will trigger the website to check for
data errors within and between forms.

Q B-10: What should I do if the Data Errors Screen displays?
A:

If the Data Errors Screen displays, you’ll need to resolve the data problems listed to complete
the ASR Forms Package certification and submission process.
For data errors within ASR forms:
1. Click the page links to go to the page(s) with the error(s).

ASR FAQs

Page 3

January 31, 2018

2. Look for the required fields messages and data logic messages (in red) to help you
identify the data errors on that page.
3. Correct the errors noted and repeat the Ready to Submit process until the
New/Edit/Print Screen displays and the ASR form’s status changes to Ready to Submit.
4. When all your forms display a Ready to Submit status, click on the Ready to Submit All
ASR Forms button on the New/Edit/Print Screen.
For data errors between ASR forms:
1. The website will note you’ve entered illogical data between ASR forms. The message
will identify which two forms have conflicting data and state the problem.
2. Click the form and page links to go to the forms and page(s) with the error(s). Correct
all the between form data logic errors listed on the screen.
3. Repeat the Ready to Submit All ASR Forms process until the ASR Forms Package
Certification and Submission Screen displays.
4. Certify your final forms and Submit the ASR Forms Package to DOH to complete the
reporting process for this year.
Q B-10: If I find a mistake, can I update my ASR forms after I’ve certified and submitted my ASR
Forms Package?
A:

Yes, you can make changes to one or more of your certified/submitted ASR forms as long as you
complete the corrections before the ASR due date (while the website is open/unlocked). Once the
website is locked, you won’t be able to change your submitted ASR forms.
Follow these steps to make changes to certified/submitted forms:
•

On the New/Edit/Print Screen, click on the Unsubmit All ASR Forms button under the
Update Submitted Forms heading.

•

Select the ASR form you need to correct, and click the Edit button.

•

You’ll receive a pop-up warning. Click Yes to proceed. A message will display that all
ASR forms for the reporting year have been unsubmitted.

•

When you’re done editing the selected ASR form, click the Ready to Submit button to
prompt the website to check your data for errors (within the form).

•

If the Data Errors Screen displays, correct the errors noted, and repeat the Ready to
Submit process until the status of the form changes to Ready to Submit on the
New/Edit/Print Forms Screen.

•

Repeat this process for your other ASR forms as needed.

•

When you’re done correcting all your forms, click the Ready to Submit All ASR Forms
button on the New/Edit/Print Forms Screen.

•

Repeat the certification and submission process to submit your final, corrected forms
package to DOH.

Section C: Website Access Questions
Q C-1: What is the web address for the ASR website?
A:

The ASR website’s address is https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/ccc/

ASR FAQs

Page 4

January 31, 2018

Q C-2: When I try to access the website, I get a message saying the page is not available.
A:

The ASR website may be temporarily unavailable due to the programmer making updates. If you
can’t access the website, wait 15 to 30 minutes and try again.
Sometimes typing https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/ccc/ in your browser’s address box will solve the
problem.
If you’re still have trouble accessing the website, contact your Information Technology (IT) staff,
email DOH EPH CCC Program, or call DOH CCC Program staff in Olympia for help.

Section D – PWS Contact Information Screen
Q D-1: We have several certified CCSs that work for our system. Whose name should appear on
the PWS Contact Information Screen?

A:

We define CCC Program Manager and PWS Manager as follows:
CCC Program Manager is the certified Cross-Connection Control Specialist (CCS) who:
•

Is designated by the purveyor to be in responsible charge of the CCC Program, as
required in WAC 246-292-054(4).

•

Manages the CCC Program for the PWS.

•

Is responsible for the development and day-to-day implementation of the CCC Program.

PWS Manager is either the:
•

Person that directly supervises the Designated CCS/CCC Program Manager; or

•

Manager having direct oversight of the CCC Program.

Note: the PWS Manager doesn’t need to be in charge of the entire PWS.
Q D-1: In our water system, the same person fills both the CCC Program Manager and the PWS
Manager roles. Do you want us to enter identical information in both columns on the PWS
Contact Information Screen?

A:

We recommend you enter two different email addresses on the PWS Contact Information
Screen, if you’re a water system where the same person fills both the CCC Program Manager
and the PWS Manager roles.
Since we send all ASR-related correspondence via email, we appreciate having two different
email addresses for your system, in case one email address becomes corrupted, is no longer
valid, or contains a typo. Providing two email addresses will help ensure that your system
receives all our ASR-related emails.

Q D-2: On the PWS Contact Information Screen, when should I use the Save button and when
should I click Submit?
A:

Use Save to:

ASR FAQs

•

Save your contact information as a draft (work in progress) for this reporting year.

•

Update your information on the Contact Information Screen only. This action will not
update the contact information on your ASR forms for this reporting year.

•

Help ensure that we have updated contact information for your system for ASR-related
correspondence.

Page 5

January 31, 2018

Use Submit:
•

When you’ve finished entering data in all the required fields in both columns on the
Contact Information Screen, and want the website to check your entries for errors.

•

To trigger access to new ASR forms for this reporting year.

•

Display your contact information on new ASR forms for this reporting year.

•

Update/change your contact information on saved ASR forms for this reporting year.

Q D-3: When I clicked the Submit button, the Contact Information Screen continued to display.
Also, I can’t access new forms for this reporting year on the Navigation Screen, because the
Step 2: Start a New Form button is disabled (grayed out). What am I doing wrong?
A:

The Submit button on the Contact Information Screen prompts the website to check your
system’s contact information for errors.
If you remain on the Contact Information Screen after clicking Submit, you have data errors on
this page. Errors may include:
•

Missing required fields.

•

Invalid phone number or email formats.

•

Emails within a column that don’t match.

To resolve the data errors:
1. Scroll down the page to see the problem fields marked in red.
2. Correct all data errors noted.
3. Click Submit again.
4. Repeat this process until you get the “Submit confirmation” message at the top of the
Navigation Screen.
5. Once the Submit confirmation message displays, the Step 2 button will be enabled on the
Navigation Screen, and you’ll have access to new ASR forms for this reporting year.

Section E: Required Field, Data Validation Error, Pop-Up, and Warning Messages
Q E 1: When working on the PWS Contact Information Screen or one of my ASR forms, a red
“required” displayed when I tabbed away from certain fields. What is this and what should
I do?
A:

This is a Required Field Message. These messages appear when you’ve failed to enter data into
a field DOH requires you to complete. You must complete all required fields to:
•

Successfully Submit your PWS Contact Information and gain access to new ASR forms.

•

Pass the data error checks within forms and change the status of each ASR form to
Ready to Submit.

•

Pass the data error checks between forms and proceed to the ASR Forms Package
Certification and Submission Screen.

Q E 2: When I tried to Submit my PWS Contact Information, a gray Validation Error message
popped up. What is this and what should I do?
A:

This is a Validation Error Message pop-up for a missing phone number.

ASR FAQs

Page 6

January 31, 2018

You must complete the phone number fields in both the CCS/CCC Program Manager and PWS
Manager columns to successfully Submit your PWS Contact Information and gain access to new
ASR forms.
Q E 3: Sometimes I get a gray box that pops up when I leave a field on one of the ASR forms.
What is this and what should I do?
A:

This is either a Data Logic Message or Reminder Message pop-up. We’ve developed:
•

Data Logic Messages to let you know you’ve entered illogical data on an ASR form. For
example, we’ve included data logic messages on pages 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the blue form.

•

Reminder Messages to remind you to complete additional:
o

ASR forms, such as the Severe Health Hazard Facilities Form (gray) or new
Exceptions Forms (green), based on the data just entered.

o

Steps to Submit your ASR Forms Package to DOH.

If you get a pop-up message, click “Close” to get rid of the pop-up box, and for:
•

Data Logic Messages, correct the data entered, either in the field in question or in the
comparison field, to make the values logical; or

•

Reminder Messages, complete the additional ASR form(s) and/or form submission steps
noted.

Q E 4: A Warning! message box popped up when I clicked the Unsubmit All ASR Forms button.
What is this and what should I do?
A:

This is a Warning Message pop-up. We’ve developed these messages to caution you about the
action you’re about to take and to make sure you want to proceed with the requested action.
If the Unsubmit Warning Message box displays, click the “Yes” button to proceed with the
Unsubmit process. Select “No” to stop the requested action.

Section F – Application Error Messages
Q F-1: I received a CCC Application Error Message when I was working in the ASR website.
Have I lost all my data? What should I do now?
A:

No, we’ve designed the ASR website to prevent data loss.
If you get an Application Error Message:
•

Contact DOH CCC Program Staff right away.

•

Follow the on-screen instructions.

•

Don’t work on the ASR form page or screen that triggered the error message until you
hear from DOH.

When you receive an Application Error Message, the website automatically notifies DOH IT
staff, so our programmer can troubleshoot the problem.
Once the programmer identifies the cause of the problem, DOH CCC staff will contact you.
We’ll let you know we’ve fixed the error at DOH (if the website caused the problem), or we’ll tell
you what corrections you need to make to resolve the problem.

Blue Form Part 3: System Characteristics
Q H-3: How do I count connections for purposes of Page 1 Part 3A? Do I use actual connections
(as counted by our system), “DOH calculated,” or “DOH-approved” as shown on our Water
Facilities Inventory (WFI) form?
A:

For purposes of Part 3A, use the actual number of service connections counted by your water
system. This may differ from the WFI information, because of counting methods.
For example, for WFI purposes, DOH counts the living units in a multifamily building as
separate connections, but the water purveyor may count a multi-family building as a single
connection because the building has a single meter.
For CCC purposes, the count of actual connections to the water distribution system is more
useful than the count used for the WFI, since actual connections represent conduits for
contaminants to enter the public water system’s distribution system. We use residential and
non-residential connection numbers to assess the reasonableness of data you report on the blue
form pages 2, 3 and 4.
We recognize water systems may categorize types of connections differently. For example, some
water systems may consider a large multifamily building as a “commercial” connection rather
than a “residential” connection. If your data in Part 3A warrants an explanation, enter
additional information in Part 6 Comments and Clarification.
Note: we use WFI total connection information to identify which systems must submit ASR forms.

Q H-4: On Parts 3B and 3C, the severe and high-hazard premises tables, should I include Table 9
premises that currently have only in-premises backflow prevention?
A:

Count the connections to these premises only in the Number Served (Column A).
Don’t include them in the With Premises Isolation by AG or RP (Column B) or in the Premises
Isolation AG Inspected or RP Tested (Column C), even if all the in-premises preventers have
been inspected and tested.
Note: severe and high-hazard premises with in-premises backflow prevention only don’t comply
with the mandatory premises isolation requirements (by AG or RP) in the drinking water rules
[WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)]. Water systems reporting Table 9-type premises without premises
isolation by AG or RP will be subject to DOH enforcement.

Q H-5: On Parts 3B and 3C, should I include severe and high-hazard premises that currently have
only double check valve assemblies (DCVAs) installed for premises isolation?
A:

Follow the “counting” directions in QH-4 above.
Table 9 type premises isolated with DCVAs don’t comply with the requirements for mandatory
premises isolation by AG or RP in the drinking water rules [WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)]. Water
systems reporting Table 9 type premises without premises isolation by AG or RP will be subject
to DOH enforcement.

Q H-6: On Parts 3B and 3C, should I include “other” premises that we consider Table-9 type
premises requiring isolation with an RP-type assembly?
A:

Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is not all-inclusive.
Thus, we expect water systems to use the “Other” rows near the bottom of the tables on pages 2
and 3 to identify other types of severe and high-hazard premises served by the PWS.

ASR FAQs

Page 9

January 31, 2018

You may enter as many “other” rows as needed on pages 2 and 3. You may also group like
premises into categories, for example, “Other Commercial” or “Other Manufacturing”.
Don’t enter low-hazard premises (such as tall buildings) on pages 2 or 3 where the water system
requires a DCVA for premises isolation. In Part 1J of the cream form, indicate whether the PWS
requires non-residential, low-hazard premises to install premises isolation preventers.
Q H-7: On Part 3B, what shall I enter on the row pertaining to wastewater lift stations and
pumping stations (non-residential only)?
A:

Count only non-residential connections with wastewater pump stations where your system’s
potable water supply is available for maintenance of the pump station. This would include pump
stations such as those belonging to the wastewater collection agency (usually the municipal
sewage system) and those located on commercial and industrial premises.
Count connections only to the non-residential wastewater lift or pump stations where your
system’s water is supplied in any of the following ways:
•

Hard plumbed to the pump station itself.

•

Not hard-plumbed to the pump station, but instead is located on the same property as the
pump station, such as through a yard hydrant or hose bib.

•

Not hard plumbed to the pump station, but instead is readily available in the vicinity of
the pump station, such that it would be reasonable to assume that the potable water could
be used for maintenance of the pump station.

The purveyor’s Designated Cross-Connection Control Specialist/CCC Program Manager is
responsible for making determinations of water use related to wastewater lift and pump stations.
Q H-8: On Part 3B, should I include premises such as large grocery stores with meat departments
as food processing plants?
A:

DOH doesn’t generally include grocery stores with meat departments in the food processing
plants category. However, PWSs that require premises isolation by AG/RP for such premises can
report these grocery store connections in the “Other” row at the bottom of the table.

Q H 9: For Part 3C, how can I find out the type and number of Medical Category premises my
system serves?
A:

Use the Medical Category Table Resource Information on the ASR website’s Downloads page.
The Medical Category table lists websites and other information sources to help you determine
whether your PWS serves any of the medical-type premises listed on Part 3C.

Q H 10: For Part 3C, how should I count a connection that serves more than one type of medical
category? For example, how should I count a building with a same-day surgery center and
a psychiatric clinic?
A:

For multi-tenant facilities where you serve different medical category premises through a
common service connection, count the connection under the medical category your Designated
CCS considers to pose the highest contamination hazard to the water system. In this example,
count this connection in the same-day surgery category. Do not count the service connection
more than once on the table on page 3, Part 3C.

Q H 11: Will my water system be subject to compliance if I report medical premises that are not
isolated by an RP or AG?
A:

Yes, unless you’ve granted the premises an exception to mandatory premises isolation based on
the results of a recent hazard survey by your system’s CCS.

Blue Form Part 4A: Backflow Preventer Inventory and Testing During Reporting Year
Q H-12: Can you clarify what the terms “premises isolation” and “in-premises prevention” mean?
A:

These backflow industry terms are defined as follows:
•

Premises isolation means a backflow prevention strategy in which an approved backflow
preventer (RP or AG) is installed on the service line at or near the meter or property line (or
where the service line first enters the building) to isolate the customer’s entire plumbing
system from the public water system. Premises isolation preventers directly protect the
public water system’s distribution system from contamination and are required for severe
and high-hazard premises of the type on Table 9.

•

In-premises prevention means a backflow prevention strategy in which an approved
backflow preventer is installed either at the point of hazard such as a plumbing fixture
(fixture protection) or at a location to isolate an area, such as a laboratory wing, within the
customer’s premises (area isolation). In-premises preventers protect the customer’s
plumbing system from contamination, and in most cases are required by the Uniform
Plumbing Code amended for Washington. Under the drinking water rules, water systems
may rely solely on in-premises preventers to protect the public water system from
contamination for non-Table 9 type premises only.

Q H-13: Many of the rows in the Backflow Preventer Inventory and Testing tables seem to ask for
the same data. Can you clarify what the different rows mean?
A:

The two tables reflect DOH’s interest in inventory and testing data for two different categories
of backflow preventers:
1. Premises isolation preventers (Table 1).
2. In-premises preventers installed for fixture protection or area isolation (Table 2).
Some rows do ask for the same type of data. However, Rows 1-7 apply only to the premises
isolation preventers; and Rows 8-14 apply only to in-premises preventers.
In addition to the two preventer categories described above, DOH is also interested in
inventory and testing data on existing versus new backflow preventers. We’re specifically
interested in data on backflow preventers placed into service:
1. Before the current reporting year.
2. During the current reporting year.

Q H-14: We don’t track atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVBs) on irrigation systems. How do we
report this?
A:

If you don’t track AVBs on irrigation systems, answer “No” to the AVB question located
between Tables 1 and 2 on page 4. This will prompt the website to enter “unk” in the AVB
column fields in rows 8 through 14.

Q-H-15: What is a failure? Why is it important that all failures be counted and reported to DOH?
A:

We define a failure as any time a backflow preventer fails to pass a field test or inspection by
a DOH-certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT) in the reporting year. When this occurs,
count it as one failure in the appropriate rows on the tables on page 4.
Count multiple failures of the same preventer as one failure for the reporting year. It doesn’t
matter whether the backflow preventer passed the field test after cleaning or repairs.

ASR FAQs

Page 11

January 31, 2018

It’s very important to count all backflow preventers that fail at least one test (or inspection)
during the reporting year. DOH frequently receives requests or proposals to relax the annual
testing requirement due to the apparent lack of failures. DOH needs accurate failure rate data
to justify the annual assembly testing requirement.
Q H-16: We require some assemblies installed at severe health hazard facilities to be tested twice
per calendar year. How should we report these tests and failures (if any) on the Backflow
Preventer Inventory and Testing tables?
A:

Count the multiple tests per calendar year as one test, since DOH is interested in knowing
whether an assembly was tested at least once during the reporting year.
Similarly, if an assembly failed multiple tests in the reporting year, count the multiple failures
as one failure.

Q H-17: How should we report detector assembly inventory and testing information?
A:

Count each RPDA or DCDA as a single assembly, i.e. only once in the RPDA or DCDA
column as appropriate. Don’t count the bypass separately.
Count as one test the tests of the mainline assembly and bypass assembly. Count as one failure
the failure of either the mainline or bypass assembly or both assemblies.
Count an entire detector assembly removed from service as one assembly removed from
service.
Do not count a bypass assembly replacement as a detector removed from service.

Q-H-18: Our system tracks both premises isolation and in-premises/fixture protection backflow
preventers. Which ones do we report in Part 4A?
A:

In Part 4A, report preventers that provide the primary means of backflow prevention for the public
water system. In other words, count the preventers that directly protect the public water system from
contamination. You must count and report the following backflow preventers:
• Premises isolation backflow preventers.
• Fixture protection (or area isolation) backflow preventers that directly protect the public water
system. You must report these for connections where no premises isolation backflow preventer
is installed.
To illustrate, consider the following examples:
Example 1: Table 9 Facility with Premises Isolation
• A premises isolation RPBA is installed on the service line to the facility at the meter.
• All fixtures within the facility’s plumbing system have the proper backflow preventers.
• Count and report only the premises isolation RPBA. Include the count in Part 4A Table 1.
Example 2: Non High-Hazard Facility with Dedicated Irrigation Line without Chemical Injection
• A DCVA is installed on the dedicated irrigation line to this facility.
• No other hazards have been identified for this facility.
• Count and report the DCVA as a Premises Isolation Preventer in Part 4A Table 1.
Example 3: Non High-Hazard Facility with Fixture Protection Only (no premises isolation).
• Your system serves a small convenience store. Your CCS’s hazard survey determines this is not a
high-hazard facility and does not require a premises isolation backflow preventer.
• The store decides to install a carbonated beverage machine.

•

As required by the Uniform Plumbing Code amended for Washington, the owner installs an
RPBA on the water supply line to the carbonated beverage machine.
The purveyor relies on the in-premises, fixture protection RPBA on the beverage machine to
protect the public water system.
Count and report the RPBA as an In-Premises Preventer in Part 4A Table 2.

•
•

We’re aware that some municipal purveyors track all assemblies within their cities. To ensure proper
reporting on your ASRs, you should track the following for each backflow preventer in your database:
•

Function: whether the backflow preventer is installed for premises isolation or in-premises
prevention (fixture protection or area isolation).
Whether the backflow preventer directly protects the public water system, so you can determine
whether you need to include it in the counts in Part 4A.

•

Q H-19: Can you give an example on how to properly complete one of the Part 4A tables?
A:

Yes. Assume that:
1. A water system has 50 premises isolation DCVAs in service at the beginning of the
reporting year.
2. Of these 50 DCVAs, 45 were inspected and tested during the reporting year and 4 failed.
Assume that during the reporting year:
1. 8 new premises isolation DCVAs were installed as follows:
a. 5 were installed at connections not previously protected.
b. 3 were installed to replace existing DCVAs (beyond repair).
2. All 8 new DCVAs were tested upon installation and 1 failed.
3. 2 existing premises isolation DCVAs were replaced by premises isolation RPBAs (due to
a change in use of the premises).
4. 1 existing premises isolation DCVA was removed from service (building demolished).
Report the entries in Table 1 under the DCVA column for rows 1-7 as follows:

replaced by RPBAs, and 1 removed but not replaced.
**The website calculates the Total of 52 DCVAs as follows: 50 existing DCVAs plus 8 new DCVAs installed during the
reporting year, minus 6 taken out of service. In this example, you should report the 2 new premises isolation RPBAs
(replacing the DCVAs) in the Table 1 RPBA column in row 4 (installed in the reporting year).

Blue Form Page 5 Part 4B: Other Implementation Activities
Q H-20: Can you explain what you’re looking for in the On-Site Hazard Surveys table?
A:

We’re interested in knowing:

•

Whether your system’s CCS conducted any hazard surveys during the reporting year and
the total number of surveys conducted.

•

Of the hazard surveys conducted in the reporting year, how many new connections and
how many existing connections your CCS evaluated for cross-connections.

•

Of the connections surveyed in the reporting year, how many new connections and how
many existing connections required backflow prevention to protect the public water
system from contamination. For reporting purposes, you should include connections
where your CCS required either premises isolation or in-premises preventers to protect
the public water system.

•

For existing connections requiring backflow prevention, count connections that needed a
new backflow preventer (no backflow preventer installed previously), additional backflow
prevention (for example, premises isolation), or a more protective backflow preventer
(RP required where had DC before).

For example, during the reporting year, your CCS conducted a hazard survey of an existing
hospital. The CCS found 4 connections, and none of them had premises isolation backflow
preventers installed. For this scenario, you would:
•

Answer “Yes” to the hazard survey question and report conducting one (1) on-site
hazard survey.

•

Report four (4) connections surveyed for hazards to PWS (in row #1 of hazard survey
table in the existing column).

•

Report that four (4) connections required backflow prevention to protect the public water
system from contamination (row #2 of hazard survey table in the existing column).

Blue Form Part 5: Backflow Incidents, Risk Factors and Indicators
Q H-21: Do we include water leaks (at joints) as “main breaks”?
A:

Do not count leaks at joints or corporation stops as main breaks. However, if your system
didn’t distinguish between these for the reporting year, estimate the number of main breaks in
Part 5, and provide an explanation in the Part 6: Comments and Clarifications section of the
blue form. Next reporting year, track and report main breaks separately from water leaks.

Q H-22: Do we include planned or scheduled water outages as “water outage events”?
A:

Yes, you should include planned or scheduled water outages as water outage events, because
they may result in backflow from connections to premises without backflow prevention.

Section I - Cross-Connection Control Program Summary (cream form)
Q I-1: Do I have to complete every field on the cream form?
A:

Generally, yes, except for fields the website completes for you. The website disables and grays out these
fields.
Please note the website completes Part 1L row 3 on page 3 of the cream form based on your water system’s
past Exceptions (green form) data.

Q I-2: Does the cream ASR form include data error checks like the other ASR forms?
A:

Yes, like the other ASR forms, the cream form includes data error checks to help users provide
complete and logical CCC data.
Click Ready to Submit to trigger the data checks within the form. If the Data Errors Screen
displays:
1. Click the page links to go to the page(s) with the error(s).
2. Look for the required fields messages and data logic messages (in red) to help you

Q I-3: We’re revising our written CCC Program Plan. What should we report on the cream ASR?
A:

Report on the status of your written CCC Program Plan at the end of the reporting year
(December 31st).
Note in Part 3: Comments and Clarifications, that you’re revising your written CCC Program
Plan.
Next year, update your cream form responses based on the revised CCC Plan.

Q I-4: On page 1, Part 1A, why doesn’t the Program Type list include a category where the PWS
relies solely on an In-Premises Prevention (fixture) type of a CCC Program?
A:

Implementation of a CCC Program that relies on In-Premises Prevention (fixture protection) as
the only method of backflow prevention does not comply with the Washington’s state drinking
water regulations [WAC 246-290-490(2)(f)]. Under the WAC, the water system must implement
either a:
1. Premises isolation only program.
2. Combination program that relies on both premises isolation and in-premises
prevention.
Per WAC 246-290-490(4)(b), the water system must be protected from backflow from severe
and high-hazard premises(such as those listed on Table 9) by a premises isolation RP or AG.
Severe hazard premises require additional backflow prevention (in-plant air gaps) if an RPtype assembly is installed for premises isolation.
Some water systems may not currently serve any severe or high-hazard premises requiring
mandatory premises isolation. However:

ASR FAQs

•

When a high-hazard facility applies for water service, the water system must require a
premises isolation AG or RP to be installed before providing service.

•

If a severe hazard facility applies for water service, the water system must require
backflow prevention per WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)(ii) to be installed before providing
service.

Cream Form Part 1B: Coordination with Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).
Q I-5: Who is the “Authority Having Jurisdiction”?
A:

For ASR purposes, the term “AHJ” means the local official, department, or agency that enforces,
in the water system’s service area, the plumbing code adopted by the Washington State Building
Code Council.
Typically, the City or County Building Official acts as the AHJ. However, for unincorporated
areas and certain cities in King County, Seattle-King County Health Department assumes this
role.
The Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) amended for Washington is the current state plumbing code.
The term “AHJ” replaces the term “Local Administrative Authority” (LAA) used previously in
the UPC.
Do not list DOH, other local health jurisdictions, fire districts, or other state agencies as AHJs,
since they don’t enforce the UPC.

Cream Form Part 1D: Typical Program Responsibilities
Q I-6: What do you mean by “Responsible Party”?
A:

Generally we mean the entity that arranges and directly pays for the CCC Program Activity
listed..

Cream Form Part 1E: Backflow Prevention for Fire Sprinkler Systems
Q I-7: For retrofits to high and/or low-hazard fire sprinkler systems, we allow a range of number
of days for compliance. What should we enter in the field provided?
A:

Enter the larger number of days in the range, since you can enter only one value in each
“number of days” field. The website blocks entry of text or characters (such as dashes or math
symbols) in these fields.

Cream Form Part 1J: Backflow Prevention for Non-Residential Connections
Q I-8: What types of non-residential customers fall into the various categories?
A:

Examples of non-residential customers in the various categories include but are not limited to:
•

Commercial: Stores, shopping centers, gas stations, restaurants, office buildings.

•

Industrial: Plants for manufacturing aircraft, automotive, electronic, or wood products.

•

Institutional: Schools, college campuses, and government buildings.

Cream Form Part 1L: Policies Regarding Exceptions to Mandatory Premises Isolation
Q I-9: How do I fill out Page 3 Part 1L about my system’s Exceptions policies and procedures?
Why can’t I enter data in Row 3?
A:

The following describes the items in Part 1L:
•

ASR FAQs

Row 1: Your written CCC Program Plan should specify whether your water system
allows or prohibits Exceptions. Select the “Yes” or “No” radio button to reflect your
system’s choice. If your CCC Program Plan is silent on the issue of Exceptions, or if you
don’t have a written Program Plan, select the “Doesn’t Address” radio button.
Page 16

January 31, 2018

•

Row 2: If your water system granted or would consider granting new Exceptions in the
reporting year, select the “Yes” radio button (regardless of your answer in Row 1).

•

Row 3: The website answers this question for you based on your water system’s
Exceptions history from past reporting years. The website will select the “Yes” radio
button if your system reported granting any Exceptions in past reporting years
(regardless of your answers in either Row 1 or Row 2).

Note: Selecting the “No” radio button in Row 2 will block access to new Exception (green)
forms. If the “Yes” radio button in Row 3 is checked, you’ll be able to access past Exceptions on
the List of Exceptions Screen to view, print, renew, or cancel. See Q J-4 for more information.

Cream Form Part 2: CCC Program Record-Keeping Software
Q I-10: We used Access, Excel, or other similar software to develop our water system’s CCC
record-keeping system. Is that considered “Custom-Developed” CCC software?
A:

Use the guidelines below to help answer your question. Select:
•

Custom Developed for or by PWS if your water system’s CCC record-keeping system
took considerable time and effort to develop (requiring the expertise of database
programmers) and includes many automated operations.

•

Other Commercial (non-CCC) Software if your water system uses commercial software
such as Access or Excel essentially off-the-shelf (“as is”) or with minimal customization.

If your water system uses commercially available CCC software (such as Tokay or XC2)
customized for your system, identify the name of the commercial software used. Do not select
“Custom-Developed”.

Section J - Exceptions to High-Hazard Premises Isolation (green form)
Q J-1: Can you please clarify what an Exception is?
A.

An Exception is a waiver from mandatory premises isolation (with an RPBA or AG) granted to
the customer by the purveyor.
The drinking water rules don’t require purveyors to grant exceptions. Instead, under WAC 246290-490(4)(b)(iii), purveyors have the option to grant exceptions. Purveyors may grant
exceptions:
•

On a case-by-case basis to premises that would normally require mandatory premises
isolation per Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490.

•

To specific high-hazard premises, only if the purveyor’s CCS determines that no hazard
exists.

Your water system’s CCC Program Plan should specify whether your system, by policy, grants or
doesn’t grant Exceptions. See the DOH CCC Guidance Manual for Small Water Systems for
more information.
Q J-2: Our water system granted a new Exception in the reporting year, and we renewed some
past Exceptions. Does our system have to complete every field on the Exception (green)
form to pass the data error checks within the form?
A:

Generally, yes.
See below for details.

ASR FAQs

Page 17

January 31, 2018

Pay attention to the following parts of the green form:
Part 2: Premises Information
• You must complete the Premises Name, Service Address, and Premises Type fields since
they’re required fields.
•

Make sure you select the applicable Table 9 Premises Type or Category from the
dropdown box. Otherwise your Table 9 category will be recorded as Agricultural.

Part 3: Hazard Evaluation and Exception Dates
• You must enter dates in Rows A through D since they’re required fields. Establishing an
Exception Expiration Date and Next Hazard Evaluation Date helps ensure the water
system’s designated CCS periodically reviews and confirms the validity of the Exception.
•

To ensure protection of the public water system, DOH recommends that the purveyor’s
designated CCS re-evaluate all Exceptions every 1-2 years (or more frequently if a tenant
change or change in use of the premises or plumbing is likely).

Part 4: Justification for Granting Exception to Premises Isolation
• You must report at least one reason for granting the Exception (this is a required field).
•

If none of the typical reasons listed apply to your Exception, type your justification in the
“Other” row text box, and check the “Other” row check box.

Q J-3: Should I access and click the Save or Ready to Submit button on a new Exception (green)
form if I didn’t grant any exceptions during the current reporting year?
A:

No.
If you accidently start a new green form, click the New/Edit/Print Screen button at the bottom of
the form to exit the form without saving. If you’ve already saved a new green form (or renewed a
past form) by accident, Q J-5 (below) explains how to Cancel a saved Exception form.
Note: the website will block you from saving or submitting a blank green form.

Q J-4: I want to fill out a new Exception (green) form, but the New green forms button on the
New/Edit/Print Forms Screen is grayed out/disabled. What should I do?
A:

We base your access to new green forms on your answers to either of the following:
•

Blue form Page 5 Part 4B. If you report that your system granted new premises
isolation exceptions in the reporting year, you’ll have access to new green forms.

•

Cream form Page 3 Part 1L. If you select the “Yes” radio button on row 2, you’ll have
access to new green forms. See Q-I-9 form more information on Part 1L of the cream

the cancelled Exception will change to Cancelled.
Note: cancelled Exceptions will appear on the Exceptions List only in the reporting year in
which they were cancelled. Cancelled Exceptions will not display on the Exceptions List in
future reporting years.

Q J-6: I want to Renew an expired. Can I renew this Exception without having to complete a new
Exception form?
A:

Yes. Follow the steps below:
1. Go to the New/Edit/Print Screen.
2. Click the Edit/Cancel/Print button in the Exceptions Section.
3. On the List of Exceptions, find the expired Exception (by premises name) and click
Renew.
4. Complete all the required fields on the Renewal Form and click Submit when finished.

Q J-7: I granted Exceptions in the reporting year to certain premises in response to DOH
compliance directives (based on ASR information submitted before the current reporting
year). I sent DOH manually completed Exception forms with my compliance documents.
Do I need to submit Exception forms for these same premises using the current year’s ASR
web-based application?
A:

Yes. Please enter the Exceptions into the current year’s ASR web-based application. Use the
data from the original Exception form submitted to DOH with your compliance documents.

Q J-8: My Exceptions List includes several “old” Exceptions with a status of Expired (assumed) or
Expired (expiration date). Do I need to address these?
A:

Exceptions to these facilities in the past. However, we noticed that on the blue form page 3,
we now only need to report mortuaries with water-connected embalming equipment and
chiropractors with water-connected X-ray equipment. Can we cancel these Exceptions?
A:

Yes, you may cancel these Exceptions, because they are no longer needed.
For 2015 and thereafter, on page 3 of the blue form, you only need to report:
•

Mortuaries with water-connected embalming equipment.

•

Chiropractors with water-connected X-ray equipment since these facilities pose a highhazard to your system. Purveyors requested these changes We made these changes at the
request of many ASR systems since .

Q J-9 Our system serves a business that provides both digital film printing services and regular
film processing services. We assumed that this facility should be classified as a Table 9
category. However, during the hazard survey, we found that the digital film printing
operation has no water-connected equipment. We also found that regular film processing
operation is self-contained - has no water-connected equipment and uses only pre-packaged
and pre-mixed chemicals (no chemical mixing on site). Is it appropriate to grant an
Exception to this business?
A:

If after the hazard evaluation, your CCS determines that no hazard exists, you may grant an
Exception to this facility. Complete an Exception form explaining the reason for granting the
Exception. Part 4 of the green form lists typical reasons including one for film printing/film
processing facilities with no water-connected equipment. You must conduct periodic reevaluations to ensure that the facility still qualifies for the Exception.

Section K – Severe Health Hazard Facilities (gray form)
Q K-1: My system serves a severe health hazard facility (SHHF) that does not have an NPDES
permit from the Department of Ecology. Do I have to include the facility on the gray form?
A:

Yes. Some SHHFs such as nuclear reactors do not have NPDES permits (or the equivalent).
Some wastewater facilities do not have NPDES permits, because they discharge to another
facility with a permit. DOH still considers these facilities SHHFs, because these premises pose a
severe hazard to the water system.

Q K-2: All the hose bibs at the SHHF that my system serves have “air gaps”, because they don’t
have any hoses attached to the hose bibs unless we’re are using them. Do these qualify as
in-plant air gaps for purposes of compliance?
A:

No! An approved in-plant air gap for a SHHF must be permanently installed and must be on the
process water line, not at the fixture. DOH will send you (upon request) an illustration of an
approved RPBA and in-plant air gap combination.

Q K-3: My system has multiple water service connections (4) to the same severe health hazard
facility (SHHF), a large wastewater treatment plant. I’ve reported the correct number of
connections (4) in the wastewater treatment plant row on page 2 of the blue form. How
should I report this information on the gray form?
A:

We’ve improved the gray form so you can now list multiple SHHFs and multiple service
connections per facility. For the scenario you’ve described, please:
1. Enter the facility information in the Facility 1 of 1 data fields.

ASR FAQs

Page 20

January 31, 2018

2. Scroll down and identify the first connection to this facility by name. This is a required
field. Example connection names could include process water line, dedicated fire line,
dedicated irrigation line, lab building water line, etc.
3. Use the dropdown box and select the applicable backflow prevention status for
Connection 1 at the end of the reporting year.
4. Provide details about the connection in the comment section (for example, this
connection serves the lab building).
5. Since you serve more than one connection to the same SHHF, click the “Add
Connection” button to display another connection row for Facility 1.
6. Repeat the above steps for each connection listed under Facility 1, until you’ve
completed the requested information for all 4 connections (for example, Facility1
Connection 1 of 4, Connection 2 of 4, Connection 3 of 4, and Connection 4 of 4).

Q K-4: My system has serves more than one severe health hazard facility (SHHF). We serve 2
wastewater treatment plants with one connection each. I’ve reported the correct number of
connections (2) in the wastewater treatment plant row on page 2 of the blue form. How
should I report this information on the gray form?
A:

We’ve improved the gray form so you can now list multiple SHHFs and multiple service
connections per facility. For the scenario you’ve described, please:
1. Enter the information for the first SHHF in the Facility 1 of 1 data fields.
2. Scroll down and complete the information for the connection to this facility by name. The
name field is required. Example connection names could include process water line,
dedicated fire line, dedicated irrigation line, lab building water line, etc.
3. Use the dropdown box and select the applicable backflow prevention status for Facility 1
Connection 1 of 1 at the end of the reporting year.
4. Provide details about the connection in the comment section (for example, this
connection serves the lab building).
