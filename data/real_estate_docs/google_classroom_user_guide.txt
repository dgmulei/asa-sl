About this resource

User guide for administrators
Learn how to create organizational groups, set permissions,
and access audit logs and reports.

This deck has been designed to include important
step-by-step instructions for teachers to get up and
running with Google Classroom. Understand how to set up
your classes, organize coursework, grade, provide rich
feedback, and more.
We know that every school is different, with unique initiatives
and goals. While Google Classroom is part of any Google
Workspace for Education edition, we recognize that not all
schools are the same and have different editions to best fit
their schools’ needs.
We’ll explore the foundational getting started features for
teachers regardless of edition. At the end of the deck, you will
find additional resources to learn more capabilities.
